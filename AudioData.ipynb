      " Great. So what's going on? Great. Adele, nice to meet you. So in a perfect place, you would have actually been outside on a door and then you would have opened the door and come into the space. Okay. But obviously infrastructure. Yes. When we start, I'll be in the room. Yeah. I just want to make sure that you see a door. Yep. Okay. A window. Okay. If that's correct, then I can get. Cool. Okay, great. A couple of things. At some point, you're going to be asked to go from this room to the next room. If it doesn't become apparent, you don't worry about what you know. Okay, like physically. Yeah. Okay. You will see at moments on the top of your eyesight, a green line or a red line. Yeah. You mean, so you can speak. Red means you cannot speak. Okay. So as that, there's a moment you're going to use this table. Okay. Okay. Give it a nice status. Okay. And then finally, we reward people that investigate and search and do. Okay. And so you can touch anything. You can leak anything. You can be anything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. And then. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Now tell me. This is where you're –ü–æ–ªÏ§Ä. First of all, I'll go check the effects on your faceUNDÔøΩ. Well, I'm just going to detoxify some of your features. And then, a very important question for me. You've reached the Garfield, Catamanic hamstring service. I've got the sound of the birth, leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Hey. Hi, sweetheart. It's not. I have to go with the public in town. You know, for all crowds, we've been doing some research. I'm going to do a little bit of care and Christmas. Take you with us. Oh, you're really good. Just take it a shower. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just a drink on my beer. Do the bad part about having an ad for the show. The Diffy Board forever. Take a myth of the people they've gone. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. Sorry about the moose. I really meant to clean up. Since we're heading out, what sounds good to you? Friendship time in China. Should we just slum it and grab some burgers? I'm always doing for Peter. Welcome back. Peter? Wow, that's a solid choice. I didn't expect that. But hey, I'm totally in for it. All right, well, should we go? Find a place? Well, I'll look it up for you. Let's do it. I'm excited to see what kind of toppings we can find. I hope they have something unique on the menu. Yeah, I mean, I wonder if they have gluten-free pizza? I can't wait to discover something new and delicious. Cool. I'm excited. That's such a surprising twist. Who knew Peter could spark this much excitement? I'm all about it. Okay. Well, let's go eat them. We'll get a nice drink with it. That sounds amazing. A nice drink with our pizzas is the perfect combo. I'm ready for this adventure. Man, it's good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, inter. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumba. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says no ink. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no one goes full into blur in the access system. So I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. It's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew an asshole. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything important. So I need to look at what through what I nearly consisted of, what I wanted to, and what I don't answer is I need to share it. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? I mean, I thought that was your jacket, but that one looks great. Sure. I can't head out without my lucky charm, right? That's true, but you know how it is. Sometimes the little things can make a big difference. Just want to feel good about tonight, you know? It's the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Janet Jackson. Be honest. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... ...neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up riding to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticising stole my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, but that's stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get my word in edge rays. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G-Knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but... fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But... probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by, let the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking... about... architecture, and... her creative intent when she's designing, and... the music she likes, and... how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her own, from the ground up. I'm just... spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... passed in a flash, and... tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I rag late, so... while it leads to go to bathroom, and I am about to deal with it when I realise... I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole, because of the whole do-knocky gate, summons over the major day. And while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me, so... I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So... I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And... I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner, if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And... I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me, and agrees, just as violent walks by kin, and... I'm still on my knees in front of them, so... I have to make out like, I'm... tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major D. And so... somehow... I had to go to get out of it. So... surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and... I just wanted to write her something, something that... expresses what Shatchel means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What'd you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music do it and go and get a proper job, what my dad says, I mean... F***! Tell me how to do it. You know? You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or... husband or wife, what actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. Ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't miss that. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. The motherland otras. What're you doing over here? Come here. Give yourselfs at home. Just put your all into E talked about. entered this place onMUSIC Cycle Pero mujo, mujo, mujo, mujo, Tanto como en donces, siempre est√° morir. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet me, but by the night I've come pretty militant at our sleep training and going to the game with him and got crushed. By the centre-mount she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse host ever, we're just juggling a bit of stuff at the moment. By the campar and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. My music stayed off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of already. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favour. Always be a face coming up late this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical about it. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you've mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know, about whatever. Life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for when it's older. You know? See what was around him when he was baby. So, grab a pen and I'll split the paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are here in James Ross. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at Orey, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-poor thing I'm remembering is. You know, it runs me being with my sister, little. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play this forest behind our family home. This was the former parents part. And that place was like, well, we saw it safely to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're actually living in our imaginations up there. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that they clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it and just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't it? Just a sec. I'll go see you, maybe you can meet him if he's in too grumpy. Hi, hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? I miss two days. No, no, if he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the world. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, by that. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Gee, today's your kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No, no, look, Violet, listen to me. Look, I, we're going to have to pick this later. I have people who are having so, no, I'll, yeah, yeah, I'll call you back. Okay, okay, yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Sorry, I didn't, I didn't hear you guys come in. How much did you hear about? To be honest, I hardly heard anything. It was in the background, but I wasn't paying much attention, so don't worry about it. Silent judgment. Love that for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some tomatoes and put it go all then. I understand how that can be. Sometimes the noise just blends in. It's funny how we can miss things even when they're right there in front of us. I'm trying to, to be a good father and to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see a worry that often. Especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventually, but Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took over to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what helped? I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas has come at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. And get Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat to have courtside tickets at the nap thing. I loved it. Just being fair, it does also serve. I was a little late for the show, but it was human drug in the air bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to worry to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks unfunly, not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? Those moments, you know. They can shape everything. Oh God, there's a lot of different memories. Strange, isn't it? How the most significant memories can slip away, leaving only echoes of what mattered. They say that holding onto those fragments can help us find our way back. That's true. There are so many layers to memory, like a tapestry woven with threads of joy and pain. Sometimes just reflecting on them can remind us of who we really are. Yeah, that's true. Like all the photographs like that you have over on the desk, brings back good memories all the good times. What ages are we now? Yes, photographs can be like portals to the past, can't they? Each one holds a story of feeling. A moment that lingers, reminding me of happier times with Auri. Auri is just seven now. Growing so fast, it's like watching a fleeting shadow, you know. Every day there's something new to cherish. I'll tell you about the time I took Auri to New York. Please, no, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think... Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. She's gone. Tric decision, probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. And of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think... Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I didn't think they were in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, I'm so sorry, I have to come so forgetful. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Good. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh, I am aware. I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, it is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're whole demeanor. Shipped it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and, yeah, other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't have eaten with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, but getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here, and then you minute. So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This straw is... what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air That girls of poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty. No alifies, a music swells, the more you're on, the more you're on. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty. No alifies, a music swells, the more you're on, the more you're on. You bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet, and hold that grin. The plates are stacked, and soaps your sim, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fate, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it, post, and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. You played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kendelman jar, I'm velvet. In a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mama Mia in your plight. A Laura Strong's by a fan crew, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead. Slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection, and would better hear. It's like Mickey Meafos, he's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. Pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know that there's anymore, they're falling away. Slide, you're not under salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Madonam. Oh, kiffigata. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunsett covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. And this was the best day of my life. Okay. Cool. I'll let you take that off too.\n"

      " Great. So what's going on? Great. Adele, nice to meet you. So in a perfect place, you would have actually been outside on a door and then you would have opened the door and come into the space. Okay. But obviously infrastructure. Yes. When we start, I'll be in the room. Yeah. I just want to make sure that you see a door. Yep. Okay. A window. Okay. If that's correct, then I can get. Cool. Okay, great. A couple of things. At some point, you're going to be asked to go from this room to the next room. If it doesn't become apparent, you don't worry about what you know. Okay, like physically. Yeah. Okay. You will see at moments on the top of your eyesight, a green line or a red line. Yeah. You mean, so you can speak. Red means you cannot speak. Okay. So as that, there's a moment you're going to use this table. Okay. Okay. Give it a nice status. Okay. And then finally, we reward people that investigate and search and do. Okay. And so you can touch anything. You can leak anything. You can be anything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. And then. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Liu Wu Wuzhou üé∂ Lu Lin Liu Who are you? Wuzhou Condor I swear you know it's not. I have to go with the publishing house. You know, for all the crowds, we've been doing your piece of clothing for a while. I'm like, you're all about it here at Christmas. Can you give it up? Oh, I'm a little weird. Yeah. Just take it a shower. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just a drink or my beer. To the bad part about having an ad in the machine. You go, but don't drink more. Take a mint. I'll keep it. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work my high pitch. Just two seconds. Oh, no, I really need to work my high pitch. Just two seconds. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, man. Sorry about the mess. Who were you —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤ly about? Hey, get off now. Sorry about the mess. I literally vient of you. The sense we're heading out, what sounds good to eat, French, Italian, Chinese, I should just slum it and grab some burgers. I'm always doing for Peter. Welcome back. Welcome back. Peter, wow, that's a solid choice. I didn't expect that, but hey, I'm totally in for it. All right, well, should we go, find a place? Well, I look it up for you. Let's do it. I'm excited to see what kind of toppings we can find. I hope they have something unique on the menu. Yeah, I mean, I wonder if they have gluten-free pizza? I can't wait to discover something new and delicious. Cool. It's always fun to... That's such a surprising twist. Who knew pizza could spark this much excitement? I'm all about it. OK, well, let's go eat them. We'll get a nice drink with it. That sounds amazing. A nice drink with our pizzas is the perfect combo. I'm ready for this adventure. Man, it's good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, inter. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her goat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. And I really want to make it good impression. And I'm too gunked, I'm scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and a cross, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gum be yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I, I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm going to make it, but not a press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no, aim. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was homing to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swanther sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job, but I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything important. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? I mean, I thought that was your jacket, but that one looks great. Sure, no problem. Can't head out without my lucky charm, right? That's true, but you know how it is. Sometimes the little thing is not the same. But I'm not sure if I'm going to wear this for the day. I'm not sure if I'm going to wear this for the day. I mean, I thought that was your jacket, but that one looks great. Sometimes the little things can make a big difference. Just want to feel good about tonight, you know. Is the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Janet Jackson? Be honest. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. It's something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her applied. And she's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like... ...across between brought shields and Janet for Connolly. And she's just... really smart. So they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up riding to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just cooled out the urine all. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like... ...what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how... ...crisisic storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get my word in edge rays. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke and just... ...oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...jean-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But... ...probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by, let the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about... ...the architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...till it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late. So, while it leads to go to bathroom, and I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, someone's over the matredate. And while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me. So, I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matredate takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the matredate. And so, somehow... ...I had to go to get out of it. So, surely I got messaged twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this... this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean. Fuck! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. I mean, just... ...ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come clear with me. Come on, don't lose your... That's it. That's it. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. That's it. That's it. What are you doing over here? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on my dad. Switching notes. Oh, so much like in don't say, I'm always in love. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all, but by the end of the night I've come pretty milleted at our sleep training and went to the game with him and got crushed. By the end of the night she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and so on, but we're just joking about stuff and then... While it came part and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music stayed off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... Well, it's a bit of a fader. I always birthed this coming up late this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical about it. It keeps safe from this part of this existence and I was wondering if you've mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for when it's older. You know? See what was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slither paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are doing things wrong. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at Ori, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-poor thing memory is. He was already, and runs me being with my sister little. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind a family home. This was the former parents part. That place was like, well, we saw it in the sacred twist in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. The one day, we got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. The worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young, and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that they... ...corrified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it and just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way, Gizzy. Just to set. I'll go see you too, then. Maybe you can meet him. He's into grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? It's two days. Small big. Why are you like this? Shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school, because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the world. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gizzy, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a love to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Two days of cold to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Vitype! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about that? To be honest, I hardly heard anything. It was in the background, but I wasn't paying much attention. So don't worry about it. Silent judgment. Love love for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some smartos and put it go all the way. I understand how that can be. Sometimes the noise just blends in. It's funny how we can miss things even when they're right there in front of us. I'm trying to... ...to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. I'm just a little bit of a fault. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, I figured what helped. I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas has came at once. There were small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. We explored the city. We had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, I caught sight tickets at the nap. I loved it. Just few things, those are the first. I was in the morning, and he stayed up late for the show. He was driving me out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of relationship after he left. He looked on fondly, not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. Let me read. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? Those moments, you know, they can shape everything. There's a lot of different memories. Strange, isn't it? How the most significant memories can slip away, leaving only echoes of what mattered. They say that holding onto those fragments can help us find our way back. That's true. There are so many layers to memory, like a tapestry woven with threads of joy and pain. Sometimes just reflecting on them can remind us of who we really are. The photographs like that you have over on the desk brings back good memories all the good times. What ages are you now? Yes, photographs can be like portals to the past, can't they? Each one holds a story of feeling, a moment that lingers, reminding me of happier times with Aure. Aure is just seven now, growing so fast. It's like watching a fleeting shadow, you know. Today there's something new to cherish. I'll tell you about the time I took Aure to New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. And of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Stay in the path you have to. Stay in the path you have to. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. Never. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... Mm-hmm. If he was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. Where's the bookshelf? Or the drawers? Or the sofa? Or maybe under the table? How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano? all the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I just... Oh, oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh, I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys' notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh, yeah. God, if this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't have even with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. And I swear... What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. What's up? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just cut me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and you're. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and Prosecato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repair. You're a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh what a thrill. You slut me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty, no alifies, a music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your vet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps your sim, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed, now look at you all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the bake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. Ah, Laura Stronges, by a fancou, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step, only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead. Slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. I would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos, he's Craig Fenden now. He tests this big man, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide, you know the salt anymore, that parts over. Slide, that means this is not either, which means this is your object. Madhornamagafigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried, that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunsett covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. Okay. Cool. I'll let you take that off too.\n",

      " I don't have to do the whole speech to you, do I? Well, I actually I'd love to hear. Before we start, in a perfect world you would actually be outside wearing this thing and you would open the door and come into the room. But since we can't do it, you know, in the infrastructure. Sorry. I will be here at the beginning of the experience to make sure you can see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Okay, that tells me that you're in the correct room. You will see a green line and a red line on your visor sometimes. Green means you can speak. Red means that you, you know, you can't speak. Okay. We always ask people to let him finish before you speak. Make sure that you speak at this level. No need to shout. If you speak at this level, you're not here. So just make sure that you have a good side of voice. The experience will happen in this room and in the next room. The story should tell you when to move to the next space, but if it doesn't, don't worry about it. I'll let you know when to move. When you play with the table, make sure that you tap it hot. We don't want to fix it in that, but just make sure that that works. And then last one of these, you aren't allowed to grab, touch, eat, drink, do whatever you want. Okay. You said you are, right? Yeah. Now, the only thing that's going to change with you, from the rest of the people that we're going to like to do, is that I'm going to give you the controller right there. And call the menu. Call the menu here. Yeah. Look up, look up, look up, look up. There you go. Okay. And then so in the menu, you should have a, I think it says record. Record. So you should see a resume, a quit. And then there's like, sorry, I don't see the menu. Press it. I'll just press it, just press it, simple. Okay. No, lobby, main. Yeah. But you should see in, do you see the screen? I see lobby, main, in the background, but there's no window. So you see the resume quit. No, there's a, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah. So there's a resume quit. And then right next to it, there's a, if you use this, just scroll on top of them. There's like four icons. Once they stick photo, there's a record. Oh, okay, sorry. Yeah. So if you hit the record. Yeah. And then hit resume. It says continue using the camera and mix reality. Continue and then resume. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So now you're back into lobby, main. Yeah. Perfect. Here we go. Okay. So you should see a door. Yep. And the bookshelf. Yeah. Okay. So you should see a door. Yep. And the bookshelf. Yep. You've reached my door. Okay. I have a man who can't help me. I have to send to the book. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Okay. Hi, sweetheart. That's your week's coverage in hell. You know, the world crowd, but remember, you stay still. You can go back once in a while. Talk like you're a manager. Maybe you remember, oh, one more thing. You didn't ask me for that. Just take it a shower. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee, or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. I'll be gone. I'm out of bed. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up before heading out. But since we're eating out anyway, what do you think? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Italian sounds good. Italian. Italian. You're speaking well. I didn't expect that. Italian, it is, then. There's something about those pasta dishes that always hits the spot. Yep. I can't believe how quickly we decided. I'm totally on board with the choice. It's like a little taste of Italy right here. No problem at all. I'm just excited to dig into some delicious food and enjoy the moment with everyone. Me too. It's all about enjoying the good times, right? Can't wait to save us some of that amazing pasta and soak in the atmosphere. And the wine? Red or white, you think? Absolutely. A nice wine will... That sounds perfect. A good bottle of red will definitely set the mood for a fantastic evening filled with laughter and memories. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, for a marigot? So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. But gumba is sending me to the...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places of total lays. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gulked up scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set foot in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. I know the copy room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Stummer singing. Ammo last in the supermarket. So of course I take that as some kind of sign from God but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur and the access to this. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sender, the alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. It's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked hold. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Could you see if my jacket is out there? I can't remember where I left it. And I want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything important. Is this your jacket? Here's your jacket. Here's your jacket. What do you think? Pretty good. Pretty good. Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? I wouldn't. Oh, that's a bummer. Just hoping to get everything together for tonight, you know? You look fine. No response? Thanks. I appreciate it. You really just wanted to feel about it for the date. It's always the little things that can throw me off, right? You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her played. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like... ...across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... ...what's an age-ren? In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticising storm my name, my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word and age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke, and just... ...oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...ginarchy or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...start laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but... ...fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about... ...architecture and... ...percretive intent when she's designing, and... ...the music she likes, and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I can't just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late, so... ...why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole... ...do-knock-e-gate summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm... ...tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. ...to the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had to even get out of it. So... ...surely I can't mess up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what Shatchel means to me. And... I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. What you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked... ...maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... ...I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... ...sit! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or... ...husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you tell them... ...to step and do something different. Ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on our eat-a-bad. I'm just putting on our eat-a-bad. I'm just putting on our eat-a-bad. Sometimes I hear a voice that makes me feel like I'm in a dream. I hear a voice that makes me feel like I'm in a dream. I know I want to be a lot more. I know I want to be a lot more. I know I want to be a lot more. I know I want to be a lot more. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I become pretty militant of our sleep training. I went to the gym with them and got crushed. By the time she's on her blinds, she won't be able to join us. I know I know worse, however. We're just joking about stuff and then. By the time she came out, she was under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our eat-a-bad. Anyway... Look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's Mark. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... Well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keepsake from this part of their existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him and his older. You know? See what was around him and his parents. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board that. I think you could do this. I think it's gonna love it. I don't really know why they are here. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Henri. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It may be realized what a temple thing never needs. You with Henri. It must be being with my sister, but there she is. Not pity. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' style. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. We live on the right. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at a time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carrying it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. It's something permanent. Etch it in stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just a set. I guess he too, maybe he can meet him. He isn't too grumpy. I...I have that little buddy. That is her. That is her. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's shared custody. But how I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail about you. Two days will kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I hope people are arriving, so. No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Fifth. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, Scam Man. How much did you hear about? Not a lot. Wow. Okay, you dropped that. I mean, did you at least hear the power I made a good point? Things are just... Messing. Yeah, I'm trying to... ...to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either of them. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took away New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and... It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? He was taking with me. He'd never been to the US, because I all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustics lots for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some downfiring. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. He explored the city. He kept re-injuting for a bit. I took him to the sleep no more, and to the mat, I thought, I could get some napkin. The street face, because I took napkin. He stayed up late in the show. He was human dragging me out, batting them on him. He wanted to get out, and then do more, and see more. I know of you, I meant to part with you. I think I've met you in relationship, I feel like. But I want to know what you mean to me. Memory that it looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that they are. Memory. What's the one thing you would never want to forget? I mean, really, think about it. Like kids first laugh. It's interesting how memories shape us, isn't it? They can be both beautiful and painful all at once. Yes. Sometimes I wonder if the moat, what if, what if those cherished moments are like little anchors in our lives? They keep us grounded, even when everything else feels uncertain. They're certain comfort in holding on to those fragments of time. It's like they become a part of your story, you know? Yeah, no what you mean. Every memory, every little piece. It's like a puzzle, isn't it? Trying to fit them all together to make sense of everything that's happened. I'll tell you about the time I took out eight in New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look, say for. It's safer there. Well, well. What do they think? Of course they're not. They're not. They're not. Of course they're not. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. They do. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri, he was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just, I don't know where. Could you, would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet, found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. And I was just like, this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I like being feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segueed into a story about your sister Lili, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So now remember thinking, my god, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braving of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke that I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you, like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robert? I got him, really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. And I swear, what about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of my fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day's going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. We have that policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. Now I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. OK, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Stay how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That's a copper tree. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him, cool and clean. And you, your scribbles on the magazine, your flash of smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And your wrong dish, dude, he no alifies. A music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're sin, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm, reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major day, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. You're grin, your little show, but fill your meal. The same trace to beret, you play your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kendelman jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama Mia in your plight. I'd... Allora strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we're better here. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's. He's a Craig Fender now. He tests this big man, all those oranges, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know that there's anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhaw nama. Good figure, dad. Slide. Slide. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The base drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners blink.\n",

      " So, do you want to go through to the park version? Hey, how you doing? Thanks for being here. It's a pleasure. Come on in. So, a couple of things before I put this at the time of you. Yeah. Obviously, you would leave that you would start outside of this room or open the door and then you're walking to the space. You're not meant to see the space as it is, but... Okay. Yeah, for sure. I was closing. And when we start, I'll be in the room with you. Yeah, just to make sure that we see a door. All right. A window and a workshop. Okay. That's just for me to know that you are in the correct room. Okay. Sometimes we tend to... Sometimes it just grips and preserves in regards to orders. This is just a test. When you speak, speak at this level. No need to shout, which is right. When you are in... When you're in the experience, you're going to see a red or green line. When it's green, it means you can talk. When it's red, it means you can't talk. Okay. You'll do most of the experience in children's district. And that's when you're going to move to the second room. You'll move to that room. You're staying in that room for the rest of the experience. All right. If it's not understandable when, but more about it, I'll be here to tell you how you go to the next room. When you use this table, make sure that you don't do this, actually tap it. You know, quite nicely. Okay. And then let him finish speaking before you speak. Okay. The last thing is we reward exploration. Okay. So whatever you want to touch, whatever you want to eat, whatever you want to drink, you are available. Okay. That's perfect. All right. Okay. I'm going to do her. Set. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Cool. I think that's fine. You should be in the lobby. Yes, man. Lobby. Lobby, man. Okay. Cool. Can you see a door behind you? Yes. Oh, windows. Yes. Yes. Yes. And I'm sure. Thank you, sound of the berk. Leave your name. Phone number. And you, sir. Hello. Nice to meet you. It's not. I have to jump at the public in town. You know, we're all friends, but remember, you do still need to call them once in a while. You can't wait to hear all about it. You're in Christmas. You need to remember you. Oh, one more thing. You remember to bring that cake. Just take it a shower. You're on the meet, you're also on it. Thank you. You know the drill. Makers have it home. Whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. A big one. Hello, Red. No, I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. Hey, buddy. Sorry about the mess. I was going to clean up or eatin' out anyway, so it doesn't matter now. What do you feel like having? We could do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. It's gone for burgers. Ah, the good old burger is wrong. What's wrong? Did you forget your one or some fresh noises with extra cheese and fries? Sorry, I got it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Three again? No worries. I know you're going through a tough time. We all are. But we'll get by. Right? Yeah, yeah, we will. So, shall we get going? The others are probably waiting for us. I'll go to the shower and lunch. Good. I'll just grab my jacket and we can head out. I'm starving. In the evening to the same table morning. And I totally spaced out on breakfast. That's the other sim here. Sounds good to me. We can take my car. It's parked out front and we can blast some tunes on the way. I've got the new Bon Jovi cassette. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I've got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria got. So there I am this morning. And little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know that she's going to be a and I know it doesn't sound like much with this fucking machine, man. I swear, Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite and these two slit-chali sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the wreck room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. Amor last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm aligning the number dials and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out its ass and an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like RTX in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. And then I just, I think I'm impressed with you for once. Yes. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which is she wear this for the day? No way. You're killing me here. This shoe's already hate me. And now you're saying that Alfred does the immatuous offering. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one-digite airplane. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal, and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incognizate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, and I was just stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get her word in edge rays, and then, oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, jean-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the way she's just staring at me like I'm a moron, and she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But, probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it's fine because Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I regulate, so why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise, I've left the room, and I'm about to go to bathroom, and I'm about to go to bathroom, and I'm about to go to bathroom, and I've left my wallet at home. and the waiter who already thinks that I always ask for the whole GOG nickname on someone's over the main day. And Violet's about to come back any second, and the other guy at least has the nickname. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall on to men using the lid on the wall, and any otherszy of p Uh Etoy, , I started to ask for money on that log. than 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the Major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so... I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the Major D... and so... somehow... I had too much to get out of it. So... surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for violent. She's got a birthday coming up and... I just wanted to write her something. Something that... expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What you do when... when you're mentally blocked... maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... Tell me all to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. I don't actually mean to you. I'm just... maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you tell them... to stop and do something different. Maybe I just... Come on. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Come here. Let me see. Meet yourselves at home. I'll be back in a bit. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put you on the other side. Get out of the room. All right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey. Sorry about that. I... I really wanted him to meet you all. But Violet and I have become pretty militant about sleep training and going to the gym with him and you got crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline, so she won't be able to join us. And I know... I know worse, her, or whatever. We're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were... like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Ari. Anyway... Look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari... He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... Well... It's a bit of a favour. I always burst those coming up late to this moment. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Ari. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know? See what it was about when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board that. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where the idea came from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time in Ari, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing never ends. He who would worry, he wants me to be with my sister, living. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents thought. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and lily behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and we have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't it? Just a set. I'll go see you too, then. Maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, give me a break. You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple of days off school, because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. And I actually love making decisions. That money I've used in the fuck to do is not by you. I don't understand the world of Vegas. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... You don't have to kick this later. I have to kick you out, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Here you go. Speak. Fetch! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, it's coming. How much did you hear about it? Everything? I know, I know it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it, but... It's messy, you know? Things are just... You know... messy. I'm trying to... to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see ari that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time it's of Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and... It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I was taking with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas, it came at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands, like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And... He had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, I had a court side ticket set in the napkin. I loved it. The steamfermist does also have some fur. And he stayed up late for the shows, but he was him dragging the arbet in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship, I could be left. But I want to worry to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm worried. That's a pretty broad answer, my friend. But if you had to narrow it down to just one thing, what's the one thing that you will never want to forget? Family. Good morning to the family. Good morning to the family. You're really speaking to my heart now. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately, especially my son, Ori. We've been planning this trip to New York, and I'm really excited to spend some quality time with him. Oh, you're good. I'm looking forward to it, man. I feel like I've been so busy with work and music. I haven't had as much time for him as I'd like. This trip is going to be a great chance for us to reconnect. Your boy and your sister. You're going to be a great partner. I'm going to be a great partner. I'm going to be a great partner. I'm going to be a great partner. You're going to be a great partner. I'll tell you about the climate I've reached in New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. They never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. Seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. It was helping me find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. Found them now before. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. I was ready to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it meant you at your gig you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation was segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I was in braven of myself and then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. And I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... And for you, Arafoo. Geno. Got such a... This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle them. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a aware one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trip on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming. But near the end. One wrong move. One misreply. And you're on dish duty. No alebby. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're sin. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft salts. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor. Walk out the door. I set the table to in the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I've saved you, no tape. And I can count from broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trace to beret. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the Kendelman jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama me up in your plight. A Laura strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind. Don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are. Now you can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we better here. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw. He's a great friend now. He tests this big man, old old Anzus, expecting not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhaw nama. Gufigada. Oh, he's the sparking up velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out. You were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And we were all glad and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The dine. Oh, all right.\n",

At the sound of the burp, leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Hi, sweetheart. It's Mal. I don't think you'll be the public in town. You know, overall, for the best of you, you do feel me to call that number. I don't want you to do the best you can. We're going there with you. Just take it a shower. The one that me and you are all welcome. Thanks. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee, or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. I'll be gone. I know I will need to work in my heart, bitch. But I'll be gone. I know I will need to work in my heart, bitch. I know I will need to work in my heart, bitch. I know I will need to work in my heart, bitch. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. Sorry about the mess. But the mess will be gone. Sorry about the mess, bitch. I will be gone. Shout again. Hell now. Finally. So what should I just do, bitch? Pick one. Me. Yeah, bye. Let's get the others in head out. I'm starving. Oh, and by the way, I got some news about that job I've been applying for, but let's talk about it later. Yeah, yeah, sure. Do you want to take a seat? Sorry, is this normal? Like should I? Yeah, there's the one face not great, so he's taking ages to get information. Okay, okay, so how are you now? Can he hear me? I'm really hoping I get it. It would be a dream come true, but we'll see. Shall we get going? I think my consera are already waiting for us downstairs. Yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go. Man is good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning, a little gumba summons me to a office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me, but gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gunked, I'm scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensuit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set foot in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office, so I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. Am I last in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no one goes full in the blur in the exorcist, so I was hobbitin' ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out, it's our sendin' alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swanters sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't take anything, she just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and I asked whole, that was it? They fired me on this thought, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Hey, can you see my leather jacket out in the living room? I think I left it on the couch. Yeah, yeah, I can see it. What do you think? What? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Hmm, you look great. Cool, cool. I was just seeing this outfit as giving off 1997 King of Prom Reject Bides. Is everything? You have to understand, it's important that I get this right, thanks man, just trying to make it total impression to know you ever had a date by Thursday. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day, I played, and she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just very smart. So they're talking about what happened on the first date. Yeah, tell me. I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus, and ended up going to Vanda, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. I was just looking at a quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a coven-sale even more, so I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some g-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. And you asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and... her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... till it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late, so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole g-knocky gate, someone's over the matrede. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so... I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of god, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matrede takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the matrede. And so... somehow... I had to get out of it. So... surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What you do when... when you're mentally blocked. Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says. I mean... F***! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. I mean, I just... Come on. Let me try again. What do you think? Yeah, I think you are... Maybe not in this. Come on. Come play with me. Mom, what is that? That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. You know, I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on a retabab. Thank you, girl. Yeah, okay. There's place on suspida. And where we're just either. I'm just putting on a retab. And where we're just either. I'm just putting on a retab. I'm just putting on a retab. I'm just putting on a retab. So, if you can't, you'll be scared. I'm just putting on a retab. You know, I'm just putting on a retab. I'm just putting on a retab. I'm just putting on a retab. Jo√£o Stop Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all, but Violet has become pretty militant of our sleep training and going to the game rhythm and you're crushed. Violet sends a love, she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know words her as her other, we're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes... Sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create something physical for him. It keepsake from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd known that, I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a little bit of a salesman. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board there. Hmm, I think you could do this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and do a dream from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ori. I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realise what a temporel thing you're memory is. You, with Ori, the ones who've been with my sister, Middend. There she is. I'm not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents thought. And that place was like, well, we saw sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think I actually found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't it? Just to suck it. I go see you too, maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour, and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without winning every single fucking detail by you. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Fithype! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about it? No, no. I didn't hear you. How are you? Are you okay, Mr. Mide? You know, pretty good. Been thinking a lot about this trip to New York. You just... It's really been on my mind lately. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... ...to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. Yeah, I... I don't see all of that often. No more, no more. Especially Victorian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. But... Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but... I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. Because I all his Christmas hits came at once. And Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of... ...exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and head. That's great. You're going to have a great time. You're going to have a great time. You're going to have a great time. You're going to have a great time. Yeah. And... ...have Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat. So I have court side tickets at the nap today. I loved it. The screenfamous does also. And we stayed up late. The shows. But it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. Yeah. What did you see? Another new I meant to my father. And... We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I'm going to have a great time. I'm going to have a great time after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon the family. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Yeah. I did do it a lot. After that time I think that's all that they are. Hmm. Memory. Hey, let's get going. But before we do, can I ask you something? What's the one thing you never want to forget in life? What's the one thing? Hmm. I think it's not. That's what I... Yeah, it's my childhood with my parents. We go out to the park together. And they saw good memory. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there goes my shop. And they go to my shop and tell me how my children put together. Thanks for that. I'll tell you about the time I took out eight in New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, oh no. Oh no, no, no. Where is she? Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there, with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. You have either. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Yes. I'm not going to be here. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Yes. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I found them now before. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I just... Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Oh goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh, God, this is embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. And then I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this impossible to be cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting you did it if you're completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man bussles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. I looked like without that the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. Because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know I didn't know him easily how to respond. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And I was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding a meter, shifting. It was, it was like he came behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like you were completely on a phrase to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got in your sister, really. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. That I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really, I don't know, wasn't really being attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I don't really know, I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Roblin? Oh yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. Matt, what about your lady friend? Sure they share lots of water as well. No, please, this was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of my fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know? What's up, Chair? He says it must just want it. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. And this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-cooled meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm not going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby cobbler, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Let me go reveal you. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love, baby. Love, baby. So if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's played at gold and prosketopizza. Lands with flair, a nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on the magazine, your flash of smile, trip on grace. You're trying to leave, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty. No alibi, the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of Kianci port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, turn the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save you, no tape, and I can count, from broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and this dare you brought your grin, your little show, but Phil you'll me, you're the same trash to Vare, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman jar, I'm velvet in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mama Mia in your plight. Ah, Laura Strones, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid out in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now, you can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection, and we better hear. Yeah, like me, me, but this crap went to now. Test band, although one season in Northwood Nebraska, we'll under the radar. Slide, slide. Paula, Trickson, your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he got to rewind the microwave last week. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide, you know the salt anymore, that parts over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Ma donna ma gifigata. Oh, that's it? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunsett covered the streets, and it was just a dream that you were just resting after the rain. This was the best day of my life. This is what us be of. Yeah, okay.\n",

      " when technically you should have been outside, and then you would have opened the door and entered the space, but given the circumstances, this is the way that we're doing it right now. Let's begin the experience. I will be inside the room with you. We want to make sure that there is a door, a window, and a bookshelf. That's just going to make sure that you're in the right room, because sometimes you just shift. And second thing, you're going to see a red or a green bar of water at the head set every now and then. When it's green, it means you can talk. When it's red, it means that you can't talk. Okay. You will do most of the experience in the two rooms. You'll be here in this room first, and then you move to the second room. Once you're in the second room, you stay in the second room. Okay. It should be... The story should tell you when to move, but if it doesn't do more about it, I can tell you when to carry it in the space. When you speak at this level, also don't need to shout, but just a... I don't think it's a system to look at this. That is okay. Okay. And then when you use the table, and you will use the table, make sure that you hit it a little bit hard, not super hard, but just... Yeah. Not don't press it. Okay. And then last but not least, is we reward people with that explore. So just give me one second. And so when I say that, it means that... You're able to interact with everything that you see. You can touch, drink, eat, whatever you find. Now you want to do it. Okay. Oops. The button. Open it, there you go. Now you're in. Come on, you're good. It's a bit loose since squashing my glasses. Let me just pull back. Let me open this up a little bit so that we can get you correct. Is that good? Oh, there you go. Perfect. I mean, close to here. Yeah. And I'll close you up here just to make sure that's all correct. Perfect. I want you to put this thing on your person. Okay. Okay. Do I have high controls? Oh, faster. Do you have high control? Yeah. Yeah. When the Garfield Catomatic answer is answered. When do I have that? That's the sound of the burp. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Do I not need controls? Hi, I'm not. Okay. Okay. You know the world proud, but remember, you stay still, you just hold on months in a while. Cut my heel to bad if you're in Christmas. Make him enough here. Oh, one more thing. You need to remember the ring now. Just take it a shower. Ha ha. I'm a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just you seconds. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a\n",

      " and can you pass me the controller? Yes. Number two. Come on in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Thank you. So, a couple of things. Number one, obviously you're not meant to come in like this, you're supposed to be going to come in. You'll see a green light or a red light on top of it. When the screen meets your laptop, when it's right at your laptop, please let him finish it with a single time. You'll be in this room and then you mentioned the second room, if it doesn't make sense, when to move to the second room. And that you know, once you move to the second room, you'll be able to stay in the second room. Speak with normal voice and also don't shout. I'll be here at the beginning. So, you'll have to see a door, a window and a window. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Good? Yep. Cool. Just look at. All right. Cool. Relaxes down. Yeah. You know what I am, but when that buzz is deep, you don't need to call that once in a while. Can't wait to hear what's about it, you're a creeper. You need to be here with love here. Oh, one more thing. Can you remember the first thing? Just take it a shower. The one that's deep, you're all alone. Thanks. You know the drill, makers have at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take a beer. Hello, Red. No, I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. I'm not in the mood for you. I'm not in the mood for you. I'm not in the mood for you. I'm not in the mood for you. I'm not in the mood for you. I'm not in the mood for you. Dude, I'm so sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway. Right? So what are you in the mood for? We could hit that new French place, grab some Italian, get Chinese take out, or just slum it and go for burgers. Go for it, Halyam. Burgers sound awesome. I'm starving. Let me just throw on some decent clothes. I've got some news to share with you too. But hold on a sec. I need trees. I'm always down to try some menu. Leave the way. That's good, I should think. Yeah, go for it. I think so. So guess what? I had an interview yesterday, and I think I might have landed that job at the record store. Fingers crossed, man. Yeah, I'll click. They said they'll let me know by tomorrow. But the manager seemed really cool, and into the same kind of music as me. So I'm keeping my hopes up. Yeah, that should be good. Man, it's good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, I think I'm going to have to go back to work. I'm going to have to go back to work. I'm going to have to go back to work. I'm going to have to go back to work. I'm going to have to go back to work. What about your publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of, sure, you know, a kind of boundary with these intentionally manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? little gumber. You know, front-mariya got. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to a office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed, and how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me, but gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to us with directions, so I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensued to eyeball in me, and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal, but I know the copier room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit is coming in from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office, so I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing in Joe Stummer's singing, I'm all last in the supermarket, so of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up with a document and I'm aligning the number down, and I'm thinking it's screw you Joe Stummer, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low ink. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And note she goes full in the blur in the excess distance, so I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's fire in paper, I was at our send an alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swam to sadness, and little goon was there with them, she doesn't take anything, she just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew an asshole, that was it, they fired me on this thought, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, out of that, just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Hey my friend, can you see my jacket out there? What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this to the day? Yeah, looks okay. Cool, thanks for checking. So how's it going? Ready to eat? Yeah, down for it. Alright, silence speaks louder than I am. I was thinking we could hit that new diner that just opened up, shall I just, I've been hearing great things about it. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster, that's why I'm going for this, something mutual. Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time. Her name is Violet and I met her on the gate I played and she's just really cool. She's stone to the in-architect and she's funny and beautiful, like across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting for me. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I look like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like what's her name? Adrian, in Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone and I'll hurt to get in word in age raised and then. Oh Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just, oh it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it's just a tally in place. I say something done asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gets violent the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late so why not at least go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky guy summons over the major day. And violence about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just, if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major day. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I've got this thing. It's for violent. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean I like it but where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to stop and do something different. Let me just... Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. That's it. No! No! No! What are you doing? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your arm into bed. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your arm into bed. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your arm into bed. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your arm into bed. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the night I'm completely militant of our sleep training and going to begin with and then you got crushed. By the sense of love she's on the line so she won't be up the join us. I know, I know, worse her setup. We're just joking a bit at a stuff at the moment. By the campar and she's under pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. Always burst those coming up late to this moment and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of my physical parts. It keeps safe from this part of this existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for when it's older, you know? See what was around him when he was saying this. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board that. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orey, I remember things from my childhood. Things like the God. But knowing you realise what a temple thing in memory is, you were going to be with my sister a minute. There she is. She's not picking. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family had this was the former parents part. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we really got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found we're getting pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just help easier is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't? Just a set. I'll go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him in two grumpy. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, Jimmy and Brad missed two days. It's not a big violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's more like he's being. Listen to yourself for a second though, yeah? No, you don't understand violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. No, no, no, no, violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I'm going to have to pick this later. I hope people are arriving so. No, I'll. Yeah? Yeah, I'll call you back. Yeah, that's time. Speak up. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Not much. That's kind of you to say. I've had enough of my life to sector by strangers, you know. You're welcome, my friend. I'm glad you could make it over. I was your day, you know. I'm trying to be a good father and to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see you guys. I'm sorry that often. Especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I've forgotten you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what helped? I'll take him with me. We never been to the US because I all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small, acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some downtime and we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And we had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat. Of course I took it to the next day. Loved it. The streamfermist does awesome. We stayed up late for the shows, but it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I wanted to know what he means to me. I wanted to have memory that he looks on the bottom of me. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. memory. If I had to ask you something, what's the one thing that no matter how old we get, you'll never want to forget. It's a tough one. I've been thinking about that a lot lately, especially with the trip to New York coming up. Yeah, I don't know. No worries, take your time. I've been struggling to put into words what I want to remember too. Music. That's beautiful. My son Ori loves listening to my guitar. Reminds me of when I was his age. I'll tell you about the climate I ate in New York. Please, no, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Please, no, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just, I don't know where. Could you, would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf or in the cabinet. I found them there before. All the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, I'm so sorry, I've become so forgetful. They're just... Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. That was scary. I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me boister notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Bylett the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of some way. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first dates, I usually only involved small talk. So I never remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and there's other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself a little bit about him. I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really dating and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. But you are a fool. Geno. Got such a... These guys said she's lost this wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. That the copper fit here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last-ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty. Alify the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're sin. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A matri-date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. On the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a great band now. He tests this big man, old ongers, back in knockup Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Power tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. That's a big man. Slide. Oh, he's the sparking up velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were standing after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's red. There you go. You need to start to outstrap. Really digs in.\n",

      " Great. So what's going on? Great. Adele, nice to meet you. So in a perfect place, you would have actually been outside on a door and then you would have opened the door and come into the space. Okay. But obviously infrastructure. Yes. When we start, I'll be in the room. Yeah. I just want to make sure that you see a door. Yep. Okay. A window. Okay. If that's correct, then I can get. Cool. Okay, great. A couple of things. At some point, you're going to be asked to go from this room to the next room. If it doesn't become apparent, you don't worry about what you know. Okay, like physically. Yeah. Okay. You will see at moments on the top of your eyesight, a green line or a red line. Yeah. You mean, so you can speak. Red means you cannot speak. Okay. So as that, there's a moment you're going to use this table. Okay. Okay. Give it a nice status. Okay. And then finally, we reward people that investigate and search and do. Okay. And so you can touch anything. You can leak anything. You can be anything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. And then. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yep. You've reached the Garfield Catamanic Anntering Service. I think the sound of the birth, leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. I'll speed up. I have to go with the publishing house. You know the world crowd, but remember, you do still need to go back home. I want to do a little bit of care and Christmas. I'm going to do a little bit of care and Christmas. Just take it a shower. You know the drill. Makers have at home. Whatever. Just a drink on my beer. Take a beer. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. Sorry about the noise. I really meant to clear you. Since we're heading out, what sounds good to you? French Italian, Chinese, I'm sure we just slum it and grab some burgers. I'm always done for pizza. Welcome back. Wow, that's a solid choice. I didn't expect that. I'm totally in for it. Should we go to a place? Well, look it up for you. Let's do it. I'm excited to see what kind of toppings we can find. I wonder if they have gluten-free pizza. I can't wait to discover something new and delicious. Cool. It's always fun to... That's such a surprising twist. Who knew pizza could spark this much excitement. I'm all about it. Okay. Well, let's go eat them. We'll get a nice drink with it. That sounds amazing. A nice drink with our pizzas is the perfect combo. I'm ready for this adventure. Man, it's good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, inter. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. She's one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, frontmariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to her office. She's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her goat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, where the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gunked, I'm scared of little gumba to ask with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stommer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stommer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But not a press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no ink. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin alarm sounding. And the staff are worse off from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swanthus sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I just want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything important. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? I mean I thought that was your jacket, but that one looks great. Sure, no problem. Can't head out without my lucky charm, right? That's true, but you know how it is. Sometimes the little things can make a big difference. Just want to feel good about tonight, you know. I'm not going to be a bad dancer because I look like a backup dancer for Janet Jackson. Be honest. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the gate I played. And she's just really cool. She's stunning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful. Like, across between brought shields and Janet for Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up riding to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in edge rays. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some g-knocky or something equally ignorant and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by let the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my God, this gifil is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ride late so while at least to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate, someone's over the maturday. And while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me. I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on my cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major det. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messled twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this... this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. I mean, just... ...ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't lose that. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over here? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on my dad. I'm just putting on my dad. I'm just putting on my dad. I'm just putting on my dad. So much as you are, ...you're always in love. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But Violet and I have come pretty militant at last. We've been training and we went to the game with him. We got crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline. She won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and so on. We're just juggling about stuff and then... She and I were... ...like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Orri. Anyway, look. Everything's great. Really, it is. Orri, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...it's a bit of a favor. Always worth this coming up late this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories of what I wanted to create something physical about it. It keeps it from this part of its existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when it's older. You know? See, it was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, I'll switch the paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are doing things wrong. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orri, I remember seeing from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was Orri. He runs me being with my sister, little. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play this forest. I was a child of a family. This was the former parents part. Not places like. Well, we saw it safely to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? We were living in our imaginations. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. The one day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that they... ...carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it and just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way, just to set. I'll go see you too, then. Maybe you can meet him if he's into grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? It's two days. It's my big... ...while I'm in the shed, custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the world. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Two days of cold to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Vitype! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about that? To be honest, I hardly heard anything. It was in the background, but I wasn't paying much attention, so don't worry about it. Silent judgment. Love that for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some tomatoes and put it go all then. I understand how that can be. Sometimes the noise just blends in. It's funny how we can miss things even when they're right there in front of us. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Both. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but... Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and... It was very last minute, but I figured what helped. I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas has come at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. We had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, I caught sight tickets at the nap today. I loved it. Just few fans, those are some fans. We stayed up late for the shows, but it was human drug in the hour bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more, and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memory that he looks on fondly, not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? Those moments, you know, they can shape everything. Oh God, there's a lot of different memories. Strange, isn't it? How the most significant memories can slip away, leaving only echoes of what mattered. They say that holding onto those fragments can help us find our way back. That's true. There are so many layers to memory, like a tapestry woven with threads of joy and pain. Sometimes just reflecting on them can remind us of who we really are. That's true, like all the photographs that you have over on the desk, bring back good memories all the good times. What ages are we now? Yes, photographs can be like portals to the past, can't they? Each one holds a story of feeling, a moment that lingers, reminding me of happier times with Aure. Aure is just seven now, growing so fast. It's like watching a fleeting shadow, you know. Every day there's something new to cherish. I'll tell you about the time I took Aure to New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think. Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the past you have to. She's gone. She was a poor, her work decision, probably. Definitely smart, she was, always was. And, of course, she knew I was always lost... From the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. I'm not the one who's going to be here. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or all the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I didn't think they were in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I just... Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Good. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware. I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me. Shipped it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry. But I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This thrones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty, no alifies, a music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light. Forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the bake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, turn the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save punetay, then I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and a stare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trast of array, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the kindelmen jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama mia in your plight. Alora strones by a fancoup, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? He's had more locked up than a mob account in witness protection, and we'd better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos, he's a Craig Fender now. He attests big men, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. Pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Ma donna ma gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. The red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The dye. That's it. Okay. Cool. I'll let you take that off too. I'll let you take that off.\n",

      " I don't have to do the whole speech to you, do I? Well, I actually I'd love to hear. Before we start, in a perfect world you would actually be outside wearing this thing and you would open the door and come into the room. But since we can't do it, you know, in the infrastructure. Sorry. I will be here at the beginning of the experience to make sure you can see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Okay, that tells me that you're in the correct room. You will see a green line and a red line on your visor sometimes. Green means you can speak. Red means that you, you know, you can't speak. Okay. We always ask people to let him finish before you speak. Make sure that you speak at this level. No need to shout. If you speak at this level, you're not here. So just make sure that you have a good side of voice. The experience will happen in this room and in the next room. The story should tell you when to move to the next space, but if it doesn't, don't worry about it. I'll let you know when to move. When you play with the table, make sure that you tap it hot. We don't want to fix it in that, but just make sure that that works. And then last one of these, you aren't allowed to grab, touch, eat, drink, do whatever you want. Okay. You said you are, right? Yeah. Now, the only thing that's going to change with you, from the rest of the people that we're going to like to do, is that I'm going to give you the controller right there. And call the menu. Call the menu here. Yeah. Look up, look up, look up, look up. There you go. Okay. And then so in the menu, you should have a, I think it says record. Record. So you should see a resume, a quit. And then there's like, sorry, I don't see the menu. Press it. I'll just press it, just press it, simple. Okay. No, lobby, main. Yeah. But you should see in, do you see the screen? I see lobby, main, in the background, but there's no window. So you see the resume quit. No, there's a, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah. So there's a resume quit. And then right next to it, there's a, if you use this, just scroll on top of them. There's like four icons. Once they stick photo, there's a record. Oh, okay, sorry. Yeah. So if you hit the record. Yeah. And then hit resume. It says continue using the camera and mix reality. Continue and then resume. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So now you're back into lobby, main. Yeah. Perfect. Here we go. Okay. So you should see a door. Yep. And the bookshelf. Yeah. Okay. So you should see a door. Yep. And the bookshelf. You've reached my door, feel good. I have a man to help me through. I have to sound to the book. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. I just read it out. That's a show we've got. He knows a real crowd, but remember, he stays still. He's called by once in a while. Talk like you were the manager. You're the reason. Maybe he was not the old one. Maybe he was the last to bring that to Kay. I'm sorry, Noah. Yeah. That was a good deal. Maker's not at home. Grab a coffee, or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. I'll be the... Hello, Red. I'll be the... I'll be the... Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up before heading out. But since we're eating out anyway, what do you think? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Italian sounds good. Italian. Italian. You're speaking wow. I didn't expect that. Italian, it is then. There's something about those pasta dishes that always hits the spot. Yep. I can't believe how quickly we decided. I'm totally on board with the choice. It's like a little taste of Italy right here. No problem at all. I'm just excited to dig into some delicious food and enjoy the moment with everyone. Me too. It's all about enjoying the good times, right? Can't wait to save us some of that amazing pasta. And the wine. That's red or white, you think. Absolutely. A nice wine will... That sounds perfect. A good bottle of red will definitely set the mood for a fantastic evening filled with laughter and memories. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's just like a woman who's not going to be able to do anything. Wait, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of a boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding. And she's like, it dawns on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Serent might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places of total lays. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gunked, I'm scared of little gumber to ask for directions. I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturmord singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course I take that as some kind of sign from God but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturmord. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no one goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. It's our sender, an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine. Coveted in looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked, hold, that was it? They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Could you see if my jacket is out there? I can't remember where I left it. And I want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything important. Is this your jacket? Here's your jacket. What do you think? Pretty good. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Here's your jacket. That, that, that. What do you think? Pretty good. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. What do you think? Pretty good. Is there any possible universe in which issue wear this for the day? I wouldn't. Oh, that's a bummer. Just hoping to get everything together for tonight, you know? You look fine. No response? Thanks. I appreciate it. You really did. But I just wanted to feel right in the date. You're the only thing that can throw me off, right? You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gay tech plate. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like... ...across between broke shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to Vanda. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... ...what's an age-ren? In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get in word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. I just sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke, and just... ...oh god, it just died on me. Later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...ginarchy or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...start laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...percreative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late, so... ...why not at least go to bathroom? I'm about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm... ...tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had to get out of it. So... ...surely I can't mess up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what Shatchel means to me. And... ...I just... ...can't get it on the path. What'd you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'd just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... ...sit! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... ...maybe I'm just not good at this? Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...just start and do something different. I mean, just... ...come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. What are you doing over there? Come here. I'll tell that to you. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your all into bed. Woah.. Yes, yes. I love you a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot. As long as you're with me, you're always in love. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the night I become pretty militant of our sleep training and I went to the gym with them and got crushed. By the end of the month, she's on deadline, so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, however, we're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. But when I came out of the gym, she was under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. My music stayed on for a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to take me up person to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's Mark. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. Always burst those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really understand me. How people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Ari. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. What you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know? See it was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board that. Why'd you pretend it's... I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Ari. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It may be realized what a temple thing never needs. You're with Ari. It must be being with my sister, but... There she is. Not pity. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parent's style. And that place was like... Well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and... Whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so, like, this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... Straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young, and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that day... I can't find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. It's something permanent. Etch it in stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just a second. I guess he too, maybe he can meet him. He isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. Hi. Hi, baby, little buddy. That is her. That is her. Oh, can you break? Miss two days. It's not a big... It's shared custody. But how I get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand by that. I'm actually allowed to make a decision, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Two days will kill to see the world the way he gets. But that's not fair. No. No, look, by that. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I hope people are arriving. No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Fifth! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys comment. How much? Did you hear it about that? Not a lot. Wow. Okay, you've dropped that. I mean, did you at least hear the power I made a good point? Things are just... You know. Messing. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either often. You know. Especially with Torin all the time. Well. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But... Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took away New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustics lots for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew you'd have some downfiring. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. I kept reading people from the dark. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat I've caught so I could get some napkin. He's feeling like a show. He was human dragging me out bed in the morning. He wanted to get out and then do more and see more. I never knew I meant to part with him. I didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he used to mean. I want to tell you that memory that he looked on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that they are. I'm very. What's the one thing you would never want to forget? I mean really think about it. And my kids first laugh. It's interesting how memories shape us, isn't it? They can be both beautiful and painful all at once. Yes. Sometimes I wonder if the moat. What if those cherished moments are like little anchors in our lives? They keep us grounded even when everything else feels uncertain. There's a certain comfort in holding on to those fragments of time. It's like they become a part of your story. Yeah, no what you mean. Every memory, every little piece. It's like a puzzle, isn't it? Trying to fit them all together to make sense of everything that's happened. I'll tell you about the thing I took out of you. Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look. It's safer. It's safer there. Wow. Wow. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Oh. I'm sorry. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. And how about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. They're just... Oh, dear. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh dear. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. Now this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me. Shipped it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We test met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidelined into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robert? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry. But I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. And I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. And I... We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. That the copper fear here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave Europe with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on the magazine. Your flash of smile. Trim on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I won't be singing until the end. I won't be singing until the end. You're still page one. I'll be singing. In the end, oh, what a thrill. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. And I don't play unless I've won. I don't play unless I've won. Music swells, the moment spins You bluff too hard, nobody wins So place your bet and hold that grin The plates are stacked and soaps your sim You play it slick, but here's the twist One wink, two slow, one move you missed Now look at you all at no grace A punchline wearing her perfume's trace You pranced in light, forgot the stakes She saw the seam, she knows the fake So pitch your charm, reverse that grin Hope she don't see the clown within But if she laughs and waves, goodbye I'll raise a toast and watch you try You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin While I sit slow and drink it in I've been called many things A major day, a mind reader A mood sculptor A miracle in soft souls But me, I'm just Gino I know the sigh of Kianci port I've seen a mor, walk out the door I set the table, tune the lights I cue the strings that kiss the night I save punum, tae, then I can count From broken lines to prosekom nights I've turned disasters into flair With just a gradsy and a stare You brought your grin, your little show But Phil, you'll me, you're the same trash to array You played your part, I won't deny But you can't trick the Kendelman jar I'm velvet in a hurricane The last bite on a porcelain plate The whispered mama mia In your plight Allora strones By a fan cool I am not a man I'm Gino Don't even try Great, just great Show us what you got Okay, no pressure, Chris No pressure, bye Okay Bye Read my mind then There are five objects in front of you Lay down in line, left or right But we start here, the salt Everyone starts on this What are we doing?

      " So, do you want to go through to the park version? Hey, how you doing? Thanks for being here. It's a pleasure. Come on in. So, a couple of things before I put this at the time of you. Yeah. Obviously, you would leave that you would start outside of this room or open the door and then you're walking to the space. You're not meant to see the space as it is, but... Okay. Yeah, for sure. I was closing. And when we start, I'll be in the room with you. Yeah, just to make sure that we see a door. All right. A window and a workshop. Okay. That's just for me to know that you are in the correct room. Okay. Sometimes we tend to... Sometimes it just grips and preserves in regards to orders. This is just a test. When you speak, speak at this level. No need to shout, which is right. When you are in... When you're in the experience, you're going to see a red or green line. When it's green, it means you can talk. When it's red, it means you can't talk. Okay. You'll do most of the experience in children's district. And that's when you're going to move to the second room. You'll move to that room. You're staying in that room for the rest of the experience. All right. If it's not understandable when, but more about it, I'll be here to tell you how you go to the next room. When you use this table, make sure that you don't do this, actually tap it. You know, quite nicely. Okay. And then let him finish speaking before you speak. Okay. The last thing is we reward exploration. Okay. So whatever you want to touch, whatever you want to eat, whatever you want to drink, you are available. Okay. That's perfect. All right. Okay. I'm going to do her. Set. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Cool. I think that's fine. You should be in the lobby. Yes, man. Lobby. Lobby, man. Okay. Cool. Can you see a door behind you? Yes. Oh, windows. Yes. Yes. Yes. And I'm sure. Thank you, sound of the berk. Leave your name. Phone number. And you, sir. Hello. Nice to meet you. It's not. I have to jump at the public in town. You know, we're all friends, but remember, you do still need to call them once in a while. You can't wait to hear all about it. You're in Christmas. You need to remember you. Oh, one more thing. You remember to bring that cake. Just take it a shower. You're on the meet, you're also on it. Thank you. You know the drill. Makers have it home. Whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. A big one. Hello, Red. No, I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. Hey, buddy. Sorry about the mess. I was going to clean up or eat out anyway, so it doesn't matter now. What do you feel like having? We could do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. It's got for burgers. Ah, the good old burger is wrong. What's wrong? Did you forget your wallet or some brush? What's wrong? Did you forget your wallet or some brush? What's wrong? Did you forget your wallet or some brush? What's wrong? Did you forget your wallet or some brush? Three again. No worries. I know you're going through a tough time. We all are. But we'll get by. Right? Yeah, yeah, we will. So, shall we get going? The others are probably waiting for us. I also need to share a lunch. Good. I'll just grab my jacket and we can head out. I'm starving. In the evening to the same table morning. And I totally spaced out on breakfast. That's the other thing here. Sounds good to me. We can take my car. It's parked out front and we can blast some tunes on the way. I've got the new Bon Jovi cassette. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I've got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. And for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite, and these two slit-chali sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set, but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I start myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Sturm is singing. Amor last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and aligning the number dials. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out its ass and an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, and putting it in, looking like artics in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to knock mess up and make an impression of you for once. Hey, you see my jacket out? I think I might do something. Yes. Um, what do you think? Is there any possible universe in which, is she wear this for the day? No way. You're killing me here. This shoe's already hate me. And now you're saying that Alfred does the max mess offering. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one decade-taplied. And she's just really cool. She's stunning to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus, and ended up wanting to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. So still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in edge rays, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, jeez, knocky, or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But, probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth, for a second, it's finally because I let the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so, why not at least go to Bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole June Ockie gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner, if they'll just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering, thank you, to the major day. And so, somehow, I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and... I just wanted to write her something. Something that... expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... get a proper job, like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... maybe I'm just not good at this? Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you're to... to stop and do something different. Maybe I just... I'm not... I'm trying to go. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. That's the path. That's the path. That's the path. That's the path. That's the path. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just go home. Get out of the room. Oh. I'll just go home. I'll just go home. I'll just go home. I'll just go home. I'll just go home. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But Violet and I have become pretty militant of our sleep training. I know Violet is a game rhythm and you're crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and so other. We're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. I'm using it to take her off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favour. I always burst those coming up late to this moment and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Ari. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than, you know, slip the paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know where the idea came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ari. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing never ends. He would always be with me, and he wants me to be with my sister, but there she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents felt. And that place was like, well, we saw sacred tours in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave aching and lily behind. And become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out, and she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young, and we have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't it? Just a sat. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, give me a break. You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. And I actually love making decisions. I'm not sure if he's seen the world of Vegas. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. You don't speak this later. I have people who are. No, I'll... Yeah, that's a full time. Speak up. Fetch! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Everything? I know. I know it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it. You know? Things are just... You know. Messy. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.E. that often. You know. Especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. It was like all his Christmas, it came at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some down time. He'd spent all that time together. Me and him. He'd explore the city. He had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and until the maps, I caught sight tickets at the nap. I loved it. He's been famous, does not seem terrible. You still look late for the shows, but it was him dragging me out bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship actually left, and I wanted to know what he means to me. I wanted him to have memories that he looks upon fondly, not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. That's a pretty broad answer, my friend. But if you had to narrow it down to just one thing, what's the one thing that you will never want to forget? You're really speaking to my heart now. I've been thinking a lot about my family lately, especially my son, Ori. We've been planning this trip to New York, and I'm really excited to spend some quality time with him. Very good. Yeah, very good. I'm looking forward to it, man. forward to it man. I feel like I've been so busy with work and music. I haven't had as much time for him as I'd like. This trip is going to be a great chance for us to reconnect. You're boring, yes. That's not a great plan. So tell you about the thamata I ate in your. Please, no, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look, she's gone. Tric decision, probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I found them now before. Oh, all the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing now. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh, I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes, recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh, yeah. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there, and I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy, so the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and unfriend on Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, wait into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listen, like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I got him really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno. Got such a. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle them. I die. We have the policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And uh, with this bracelet, it was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh yeah, is, tell you how you got to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Way to say it. Way to say it. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So, what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, and your please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strones. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Geno key like it's played at gold and proskato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him, cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat, you twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps your sim, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the bake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves goodbye, I'll raise a post and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. Toon the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the nights, I save you nocta, then I can count, from broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and to stare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trash to beret, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindell Menjar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mamma Mia, in your plight. Alora Strones, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now, you can move left or right whichever is closer, one step, only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection, and we'd better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's, he's a Craig Fenden now, he tests this big man, all those answers, he's practically not put Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. Pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know, this anymore, they're falling away, slide. You know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. And this was the best day of my life. And that's as far as we got. Oh, all right.\n",

I know, right? We need to work in my heart, please. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what do you feel like eating today? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Yeah, I think just burgers. Toilet guys. You know, I'm not going to eat anything. I'm not going to eat anything. I'm not going to eat anything. Toilet guys, yes. You'll talk in my language. Let's get the others in head out. I'm starving. Oh, and by the way, I got some news about that job I've been applying for. But let's talk about it later. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Do you want to take a seat? Oh, please carry. Okay. Sorry, is this normal? Like, should I? It's okay. The wife is not great, so he's taking ages to get information. Okay. Okay. Okay, talking just to see if that activates something. Okay. So, how are you now? Hello? Can you hear me? I'm really hoping I get it. It would be a dream come true. But we'll see. Shall we get going? I think my consera are already waiting for us downstairs. Yeah, yeah, let's go. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set foot in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Stummer's singing. Am I last in the supermarket? So of course. I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And looks like she goes full in the blur in the access system. So I was harbing to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little goomba's there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and I asked whole, that was it. They fired me on this top. I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Hey, can you see my leather jacket out in the living room? I think I left it on the couch. Yeah, yeah, I can see it. What do you think? What? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Hmm, you look great. Cool, cool. I was just seeing this outfit as giving off 1997 King of Prom Reject vibes. Is everything? It's important that I get this right. Thanks, man. Just trying to make it whole impression to know you ever had a date by Thursday. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day, I played. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful. Like, across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just very smart. So they're talking about what happened on the first date. Yeah, tell me. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus, and ended up wanting to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is it wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes violently, opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her own, from the ground up, and just... ...spell down. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I arrived late, so violently used to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole gee knocky gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks by kin, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the major day. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What you do when you're mentally blocked. Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, like my dad says. Say it! Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them to stop and do something different. I mean, just... Come on. Let me try again. What do you think? Yeah, I think you are doing this. Come on. Come play with me. Mom, what is that? That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on our ear to bed. Yeah, okay. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. Thank you, God. Yeah, okay. I'm going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. Hey. Sorry about that. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. I really wanted him to meet you all. But Violet and I have become pretty militant of our sleep training. And going to the game with him and got crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline. She won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and other. We're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. She and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our own. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this moment. People don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keepsake from this part of their existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know? See what was around him when he was eight. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board that. Hmm. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where they are doing a dream from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Orey. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing you're memory is. You with Orey. You must be being with my sister, Middend. She's just not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents start. And that place was like, well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't? Just to set it. I go see you too, maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, give me a break. You missed two days. It's not a big. Violet, it's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a lab to make a decision without winning every single fucking detail by you. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Fittie! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about it? No, no. I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you. Are you okay, Mr. V? You know, pretty good. Been thinking a lot about this trip to New York. It's really been on my mind lately. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. Yeah, I... I don't see R.E. that often. It's normal, it's normal. It's every father of our family. Especially Victorian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time and to be originally young? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. But I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. It was like all his Christmas, it came at once. And Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. That's great, great. You have a great time. You sport the city. Yeah. And had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat. So I have court side tickets at the nap today. I loved it. The streamfermist does also have to. And he stayed up late for the shows. But he was him dragging the arbet in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. Yeah. What did you see? I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon from me. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Yeah, I did do it. That's how I think that's all that we are. Hmm. I'm worried. Hey, let's get going. But before we do, can I ask you something? What's the one thing you never want to forget in life? What's the one thing? I think it's not. That's what I... Yeah, it's my childhood with my parents. We go out to the park together. And they saw good memory. Yeah. Well, there goes my shop. It's only I'm a chill put together guy. Thanks for that. So tell you about the time I took our eat in New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, no. Where is she? Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Yeah, it looks much older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Hey, they could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet, and I found them now before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. I just... Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Oh, goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh, god, this is embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but then I rushed... Yeah, I rushed into the restaurant, and you weren't there. And then I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this would possibly be cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of her ghosting me did it feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest... I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late, and although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here? Yeah, because I didn't want to be late, and that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry, and I'm Chris. Oh my god, I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know I didn't know him immediately how to respond. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there, shifting. It was...it wasn't he getting behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got in your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things I have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all the other first days have usually involved in small talk. Um... Yeah, I remember thinking, my god, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself, and then I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a dog. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I don't really know, I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear... What about your lady, friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom, so if she comes back here, this... I should think of my fool. Please. Are you a fool? Gina? What's up, chair? He says it must just want it. It's true, and my day is going to come back here, and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one, and this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if... What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm not going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Let me go reveal him. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so what if you got to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong... What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Call him. He's like it's played at gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him. Cool and clean, and you, your scribbles on the magazine. You flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. You're a genius. You're a genius. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one mis-reply, and you're on dish-duty. No alibi, the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your vet and hold that grin. So place your stacked and soaps your sim. You play it slick, but here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin. While I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of candy poured. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table, turned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, no tape, and I can count. From broken lines to proseko nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare, you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your meal. The same trace to the ray. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the candelman. Jar, I'm velvet. In a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mia in your plate. Allora strones by a fanciful. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right. But we start here. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account than witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, like me, me, but this crack went in now. Test band. Although one season we are not fucking Nebraska. We are under the radar. Slide. Slide. Power tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know this anymore? The phone away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Ma, the oh, na, ma, gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. There's everything from yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling. And I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The base drops low. Time took a pause. This is what else we have. Yeah, okay. Whoa.\n",

      " when technically you should have been outside, and then you would have opened the door and entered the space, but given the circumstances, this is the way that we're doing it right now. Let's begin the experience. I will be inside the room with you. We want to make sure that there is a door, a window, and a bookshelf. That's just going to make sure that you're in the right room, because sometimes you just shift. And second thing, you're going to see a red or a green bar of water at the head set every now and then. When it's green, it means you can talk. When it's red, it means that you can't talk. Okay. You will do most of the experience in the two rooms. You'll be here in this room first, and then you move to the second room. Once you're in the second room, you stay in the second room. Okay. It should be... The story should tell you when to move, but if it doesn't do more about it, I can tell you when to carry it in the space. When you speak at this level, also don't need to shout, but just a... I don't think it's a system to look at this. That is okay. Okay. And then when you use the table, and you will use the table, make sure that you hit it a little bit hard, not super hard, but just... Yeah. Not don't press it. Okay. And then last but not least, is we reward people with that explore. So just give me one second. And so when I say that, it means that... You're able to interact with everything that you see. You can touch, drink, eat, whatever you find. Now you want to do it. Okay. Oops. The button. Open it, there you go. Now you're in. Come on, you're good. It's a bit loose since squashing my glasses. Let me just pull back. Let me open this up a little bit so that we can get you correct. Is that good? Oh, there you go. Perfect. I mean, close to here. Yeah. And I'll close you up here just to make sure that's all correct. Perfect. I want you to put this thing on your person. Okay. Okay. Do I have high controls? Oh, faster. Do you have high control? Yeah. Yeah. When the Garfield Catomatic answer is answered. When do I have that? That's the sound of the burp. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Do I not need controls? Hi, I'm not. Okay. Okay. You know the world proud, but remember, you stay still, you just hold on months in a while. Cut my heel to bad if you're in Christmas. Make him enough here. Oh, one more thing. You need to remember the ring now. Just take it a shower. Ha ha. I'm a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just you seconds. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a\n",

      " and can you pass me the controller? Yes. Number two. Come on in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. So, a couple of things. Number one, obviously you're not going to come in like this, you're just going to be behind the door. You'll see a green light or a red line on top of it. On the screen it means you're at that stop when you try to stop. Please let him finish every single time. You'll be in this room and then you mentioned the second room. If it doesn't make sense, we'll move to the second room. And that you know, once you move to the second room, you stay in the second room. Speak with normal voice and also don't shout in no need. And I'll be here at the beginning. So you'll have to see a door, a window and a push-up. Start. Yeah, that's broken. That's the way that it is now. Great, I get the dodgy one. That's the mind, mind, and the missing break, too. It's just bad quality, basically. Let me get this. Let me help you. That's the way it's going to be. Yeah, pain in the ass. That's like a... There we go. There we go. There we go. Good. Cool. Just look at it. There we go. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Yeah. You've reached the Garfield Cato Maddock answering service. Got to sound to the birth. Leave your name. Phone number? No, it's not. You have to deal with a couple of things. You know what, right? You don't need to call that month in a while. Cut right here with a bad insurance treatment. You need to be here with no need. Just take it a shower. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take a beer. Take a beer. Take a beer. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dude, I'm so sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway. Right? So what are you in the mood for? I'm in Italy and get Chinese takeout or just slum it and go for burgers. Go for it, Hallyum. Burgers sound awesome. I'm starving. Let me just throw on some decent clothes. I've got some news to share with you too. But hold on a sec. I'm always down to try and some menu. Lead the way. Yeah, golfer. I think so. So guess what? I had an interview yesterday and I think I might have landed that job at the record store. Fingers crossed, man. Yeah, hopefully. They said they'll let me know by tomorrow. But the manager seemed really cool and into the same kind of music as me. So I'm keeping my hopes up. Yeah, it should be good. Should be. Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. The publishing house. Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. And little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. I'm suddenly a realised, and on the top floor. It's the exetive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and two to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set, but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm aligning the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. That is like I've killed it. And I make this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full in the blur and the excess. So I was horrible to an ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sender, an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression of you for once. Hey, my friend, can you see my jacket out there? What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this to the day? Yeah, it looks okay. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this to the day? Yeah, it looks okay. Cool, thanks for checking. So, how's it going? Ready to eat? Yeah, down for it. Alright, silence speaks louder than I am. I was thinking we could hit that new diner that just opened up. Shall I just, I've been hearing great things about it. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one day to get her played. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, I'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting for me. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up riding to Vanda. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there. So, still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word and age raise. And then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke. And just, I thought, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some gnocchi or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But, probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. So, why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky guy summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So, the major day. And so, somehow... I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What'd you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I do know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. Maybe just... Ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! What do you do? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your arm into bed. Next one. Oh my god. A little doll of gold hair. With the wind of the stars. The wind of the wind. Tell me if you want it. How I love you. Yes, of my memories. Like a child of yours. Sometimes I hear a voice. That the grey moon dies. It seems to me. If you want it. You can't. I'm so sorry. I'm always in love. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I'm completely militant of our sleep training. We're going to begin with and we've got crush. By the end of the month she's on the line. She won't be up the join. I know we're so sad. She's a little bit of a bit of a pain. She's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in a night. My music is staying off a bit. Which is great obviously. But sometimes. I don't know. Everything is great. He's amazing. It's my life. I wanted you to. It's a bit of a failure. I wanted to say something about how people don't have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create some of my physical parts. It keeps safe from this part of their existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. What you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be cool for when it's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So grab a pen and a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board that. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. He's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orey, I remember things from my childhood. Things I forgot. But maybe you realize what a temple thing in memory is. You worry. You must be being with my sister, Middits. There she is. You're not pitching. You're not used to playing this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents' job. That place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Right? We're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, driving, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. We never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. Straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found we're getting pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that. What it means to actually lose something that, that day, I'm trying to find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost. Right? Oh, the master is away, isn't? Just to set. I'll go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, Jimmy and Brad, missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second, though, yeah? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Did you just say you'll kill the people in the world when you get to? Violet, that's not bad. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I hope people are arriving so. No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Bitch! Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you guys come in. How much did you hear about? Not much. But it's kind of you to say, have enough of my life dissected by strangers, you know? You're welcome, my friend. I'm glad you could make it over. How was your day? Messy. I'm trying to... to be a good father to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see ari that often. Especially with Torin all the time. So, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I could originate you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US because all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downtime. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And we had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat. I'm caught sight tickets at the next day. Loved it. The screenfermist does awesome, though. We stayed up late for the shows. But it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks upon the bomb. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. If I had to ask you something, what's the one thing that no matter how old we get, you'll never want to forget. I don't know. It's a tough one. I've been thinking about that a lot lately, especially with the trip to New York coming up. Yeah, I don't know. No worries, take your time. I've been struggling to put into words what I want to remember too. Music. That's beautiful. My son Ori loves listening to my guitar reminds me of when I was his age. I'll tell you about the climate I got in New York. Please. No, please don't. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. Please. No, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. I don't think... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... Here you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. They're just... Oh, to you that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I'm goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me boister notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Bylethe of the day. It's the dumbest thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. When it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation was segueed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I never remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I went and everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first day and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-colds mill? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. That the cops are here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This trones... what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and Prosecutor Pizza lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clear. You scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return to the world. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast. And watch you try, you'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A matriot date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. You played your part, I won't deny. But you can't trick the candelman, Jara and velvet. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama, me, up in your plight. A lora strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right. But we start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long. Hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all those answers, but he's not a pro-Nabrasca. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Paolo tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhornam. Oh, kiffigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked, how you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were standing after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's red. There you go. You need to start to outstrap. Really digs in.\n",

      " That's a moment you're gonna go from this room to the next room. If you're not gonna become apparent, or worry about it, I'll be here to tell you. Yeah, I'm not very good with, say, gaming or like in terms of just knowing where to go or be any that. So yeah, if I need to know, just let me know. And then last but not least, you are allowed to touch, taste, eat, drink, touch whatever you want to eat. Okay. Yeah. So, perfect. Let's do it. Good, you did? Let's do it! That, come on, I'll do it. Laundyn voache. So you know it's not. You know the rules of the rules but remember you do feel need to call those ones in a while. Can't wait to hear all the bad if you're interested. Maybe you would love to or a month more than you would remember to print that case out. Just take it a shower. Thank you. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Be good. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my hard pitch. Just two seconds. Oh, just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what are you in the mood for? French, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers? Slum it. Cooper burgers. Toho just, yes. You're talking my language. Cool. And what do you want to do? I'm so down for that. I've been craving a big juicy burger all day. Plus I have some awesome news to share. No problem. By the way, have you seen my Walkman? I was listening to this new album by Bon Jovi and I think I left it on the couch. Let's get going. Oh, please. Oh, they're there. They're there. They're there. They're there. We can check out that in the music store that's having a sale. Oh, the books. No. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Don't worry, it's good news. You'll see. Let's do this. Let's do it. What's going on? What's going on? Let's do it. Let's do it. How are we, Stork? Um... Man is good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of, sort of, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, uh, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, frontmariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trippercut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the... ...copy room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensuit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower, so... ...I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then... ...somehow I... ...I actually find it. And I'm loading up with a document, and I'm lining the number down, and I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no, aim. So, I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and that is like I've killed it. It makes the kiddie's grinding noise inside. And looks like she goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was hobbitting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was at our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine. I'm covenating, looking like R-tex in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it? They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression of you for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door. Okay. Take it. Take it. Did she hear something? Oh. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which is she? Where are they still the day? Maybe. Maybe. Yes. Go for it. I think I did. Thanks for coming over for Jan O'Jackson. No wait, my jacket is on the couch. Never mind. Let's go. The others are probably waiting for us. It's important that I get this right. Tell me. Have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was... Oh, I get it. You're saying this story don't pull out the neon win-baker aren't so guess who called me yesterday? The manager from that bar where I played last week. You sure? Because I don't want to show up looking like a backup dancer in MC Hammer's next video. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting, man. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a power-chalance that were a little bit too fitted. I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. It started raining on the way, like, thundering down. By the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. She's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. I'm panicking, obviously. I started trying to explain myself. She doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there. Still sort of like a... what's her name? In Rocky? As nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's just Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G-Knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture and... her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell-bound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...till it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So, why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole G-Knocky gate summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So, the major D. And so, somehow... ...I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...beakes presses what she has for a reason to me. And... I just... I can't... ...get it on the path. What'd you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'd just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, like my dad says. Say it! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe not set. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. Maybe I just... Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Tamb‰∫Æ at the center of... ...the door goes to heaven. This is the path... ...that gives birth to your own? This witness is missing. What are you doing? Come here. May I use something? Go to the other room. No, no, no. There's no substitute. And then the chasquitos. And then they suffer. Uniquito lindo. De cabellos de oro. Medientes de peras labios de rubir. Me si me quieres como miote quiero. Si de mi te acuerdas como miote t√≠. A veces escucho un eco divino que no es tu en la brisa parece decir. Si te quiero mojo, mocho, mocho, mocho, mocho. Tanto como un dozer siempre es de amor. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the end of the competition, I went to the gym with him and got crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and so other. We're just juggling a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. I was very obviously but sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Ori. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. See what it was around him when he was a baby. So, rubber pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board that. I think if you do this, I think he's going to love it. I don't really know whether I do a things wrong. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Ori, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He was on it. He runs there being with my sister, little. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents part. And that place was like, there's sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, and she felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. It's a stone, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just to set. I'll go see you too, maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's shared. Custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. Listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a lousy make a decision, but I'm wondering if we still have fucking detail about you. Change the days you're killed to see the world away, you guess? Violet, that's not fair. No. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I have people who I haven't so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Let's see. Bitch. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Yeah, I'm just a little... Yeah. But I wouldn't know what to say either. Something is just... Don't have any answers to that. Things... That's kind of you to say. Have I enough of my life to set it by strangers, you know? Not much. That's lucky to know you. It's just hard sometimes, you know. But I think you know, everything. Being a dad, being me. Oh, good. Violet and I... We've been through a lot. Some days it still feels like we're trying to figure it all out. Thanks. Honestly. I hate that he even got to that point. But being a parent most complicated gig ever had. So not much is in nothing or not much is in. You heard just enough to make you look like the bad guy. I'm sorry. So not much is in nothing or not much is in. You heard just enough to make me look like the bad guy. Great. Let's keep it that way. The world hears enough of my mistakes already without adding parenting fails into the mix. Good. I'd hate for you to hear me lose a fight. I've probably already lost 100 times before. Not much. All the things I don't know about proudest men. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is he so talking or just... He's... No, he's just standing. Yeah. I was like, well, I thought maybe he needs to hold her something. We're finding out that this is too far forward. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You just lost a little bit into that. Sure. And to that space. See if he doesn't come back in two minutes or... Yeah, this one. That space. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Quit. You just... Oh, yeah. You just quit. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then you'll see in the bar the U4 Unreal. No. In the bottom bar? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Okay. Perfect. I'm going to go to the lobby. Yeah. I'm in the main. Do you know how to shoot a book again? Do you go black? Yeah. Yeah, and I'm bicaryon. Yeah. Thanks. You missed two days. It's not a big... My life is shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No. No. If he misses a couple of days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality... ...time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without winning every single fucking detail by you. You just need to take some kilters to see the world where you get to. But that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people who I haven't so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Fithy. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, Scumlin. How much did you hear about? Don't worry, not a loss. Okay, fine. If you're not going to say anything, I'll just tell myself, I totally won that argument. I'm not thanks for asking. You just got a lot on my mind, you know. Messy. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see a hurry that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just makes you like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. I've never been to the US because I all his Christmases came at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some downpipe. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And we had Korean food for the first time. I took him to the Slink No More and to the mat. I have quartz side tickets at the napped again. I loved it. Just been famous, it was awesome. We stayed up late, the shows. It was human drag in the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. You seem a bit preoccupied. But hey, on a lighter note, what's the one thing that you'll never want to forget? My first dog. My son, Auri, smile, it's something that ought to be. Nostalgia, yeah. Pets have a way of leaving a mark on our hearts, don't they? I'm not sure I do. Do you have any pets? I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so happy to see you. I'm so happy to see you. I'm so happy to see you. I don't remember where it is that you go. Please don't. I can't. Just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. They think. Do they. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here who's helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh, no, no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here uncertain of it. I just, I don't know where. Could you, would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet, I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. So yeah, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything, things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. I've been calling them what they remember. I got this one from Bylett the other day. It's the dumbest thing. God, this is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segueed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child. And they're getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry. But I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I'm sure that guy will come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold, the proskato pizza, lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you, your scribbles on the magazine, you flash a smile, trick on grace, you're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depth, you can't repeat, you twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh, what a thrill, you slid me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week, I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last-ditch hope, you think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. One, two, three. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one mis-trip, and you're on dish-duty, no aleb, by the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move, you missed, now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye I'll raise it post and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of Kianci port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, tune the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save punal notes, then I can count, from broken lines to prosekone nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and to stare, you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trace to the array, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the kindelman, Jaram Velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama Mia, in your plight. Allora strones, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left to right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step, only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepos. He's a great friend now. He attests this big man, all those ounces, suspect he's not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore? That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhawna ma gifigada. Oh, he's the spotkin' up velvet storm. Snapping time with the twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked like you were going to track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Slide. Slide. Slide. Slide. Slide. Slide. Slide. Slide. Or everything. Slide. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone. And we walked outside. To the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners blink. That's as far as we can. Okay, cool.\n",

      " door with the headset on and then you open the door and you will come into this place but infrastructure is so weird with it this way. Yeah. A few things to note. When we start I'll be in the room with you just to make sure that you see a door, a window and a bookshelf. Okay. Not tell me that the room is correct and you're not shifted. When you're in the experience you're going to see a green line or a red line every now and then above of your headset. That means that you can speak when it's green and you can't speak when it's red. We usually say let him finish before you speak but sometimes people are just going to put a little bit of it in there. You'll start in this room and then at some point you move to that room. Hopefully the story tells you when you need to move but if not, don't worry about it or what you know when that happens. When you speak normally, speak at this level. Yeah. Okay. No need to shout but it's just in a good level so that it can hear you. And then at some point you're going to use this table. Make sure that you tap it a little bit fun. Don't be soft at all. Okay. It'll make sense when you do that. Okay. And the last but not least is we reward exploration so go for it and do whatever you need to do. Okay. Cool. You there? Yeah. Okay. You guys? Yep. You should be in the lobby main. Says lobby main, yeah. Cool. Yes. Do you have reached the girl's account or the automatic answering? Yes. I have a message saying credit of Andrew here. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's a little crap but we have to do that. Okay. You have to say it. I have a message saying credit of Andrew here. In shoe sales. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You should be. Okay. You should be. Okay. All right. I think you just have a coffee or whatever.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm so sorry about the mess. I was going to clean up but since we're eating out anyway, it's all good. So where do you want to go? We've got French, Italian, Chinese, or we could just slum it and go for burgers. Let's go for Chinese. Oh, not ice-choice. I've been craving dumplings a week. You're reading my mind. Cool. Yeah, let's go. Where are we going to? I was thinking of that new place downtown. You know, the one with the huge dragon outside. I've been wanting to try it out. I heard great things about their kung-pou chicken. The arrow dance, sounds great. I'm on for that. Awesome. Let's grab the others and head out. By the way, I've got some news to share with you guys. But let's wait till we're all together. It's kind of big. Okay, let's do it. I'll go get Mike and Sarah. They're probably just chilling in the living room and then we can roll out. Oh, and by the way, have you listened to that new Bon Jovi album? No, I don't think I will now. I don't know, I will, but I haven't listened to it yet. You've got to check it out. It's sick. Slippery when wet is like the best thing they've done so far. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. I'm suddenly a realised I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me, wrecking it off this. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the wreck room in the basement. And the ju-box is playing and Joe Stummer singing. Am I lost in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. Screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over and that is like I've killed it. He makes this hideous, grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was hobbitin' ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out its ass ending, alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted ink, looking like artics in the swanthas sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, an asshole. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Oh yeah. Oh. You can see it hanging up here. What do you think? Yeah, looks like. Is there any possible universe in which issue where this to the day? Sure it's a bit weird, but go for it. Why not? Thanks man. I was worried it might be a bit too flashy, but I like the way it looks. Right. Do you think I'll be able to save for tonight? That's the square one. Shall I just rob a paper band? You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one day to play. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Did I tell you about what happened on the first date? God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up writing to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So, still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow they'd just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in edge rays and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking non-stop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just, oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some gnocchi or something equally ignorant and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool. And we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and told her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. So the major day and so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I can't mess up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. I mean, just... Ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.‰ª∂‰∫ãÊÉÖ Come here Just put your mobile transparent I'm so happy I've got more money. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the night I've become pretty militant of our sleep training going to the gym with them and got crushed. Violet sends a love, she's on their line, so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, or so other, we're just juggling a bit of stuff in the morning. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like, ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously, but sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to type the old person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favour. I always burst those coming up late this month, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some in physical body. It keeps safe from this part of their existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever, like, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for when it's older. See what was around him when he was a little bit. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that more of that. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where the idea came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ari. I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-poor thing that I ate. You, with Ari, you must be being with my sister, but there she is. Not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' father. And that place was like, well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind to come over the people, live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, we'd get into these castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. The one day we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, and she felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that they... ...carrified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I wanted to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't he? Just a sat. I'll go see you too, then. Maybe you can meet him if he's in too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, come here, buddy. Missed two days. It's not a big... ...violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school, because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been... Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. To date, we're killed to see the world where he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... I'm going to have to kick this later. I have to kick the wide one, so... No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Yeah. Yeah, that's for the time. Speak. Fitting. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I don't know. Yeah, I just need to get dressed and we're out of here. You know, I got some news to share with everyone. I wouldn't say either. But let's get some food for things. I'm starving. I'm starving. Do they? Things are just... You know. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see a hurry that often. You know. Especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I was an old New Yorker? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I was taking with me. We never been to the US because all his Christmases came at once. There were small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downpire. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. We had Korean food for the first time. I took into the sleep no more and to the mat I have quartz citicates at the napkin. I loved it. Just being fair, this does awesome. I was a little late for the show. It was him dragging the bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. I want to know what he needs to be. I don't know what he needs to be. He looks upon fondly. Not just the block star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. Hey, serious for a sec. What's the one thing that you'll never want to forget? You know, if you could hold on to it forever. I'm going to open my family. I guess my wife and my kids. Be sure, yeah. That's beautiful, man. Family is everything. You're a lucky guy to have that. I've been thinking about my own family a lot lately. Especially my son, Ori. Yeah, what have you been thinking? And you know that was not the best moment. I'll tell you about the climate of our Eden, York. Yeah, you tell me, yeah. You tell me when to come to New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not braving up that. It'll be there. Of course it will. If you look. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read at lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. Found them there before. All the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. No worries. Happens all of that. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. That was scary. Yeah you did, yeah. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys notes. Recallings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. I'm so sorry. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. So this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle them. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-cores meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. I'm going to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This thrones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and slick, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming. But near the end, one wrong move, one misdreply. And your on-disch-duty, no alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sin. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move, you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the nights. I save you nocta, then I can count. From broken lines to proseko nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trast of array. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama Mia in your plight. The Laura strongs by a fancou. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. I would better hear. It's like Mickey Meeper. He's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks on. Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. My own, my. Give me a fuck. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's it. That's as far as we got. Cool. Great. There we go. Cool. Thanks, Juan. Great. Thanks.\n",

      " It's just to confirm that you see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. It will tell me that the space is correct for you. Another thing is you'll see a red bar and a green bar every now and then. When you see the green bar and you can talk, when you see the red bar, it means that he's not listening to you. Let him finish before you speak every single time. At some point you're going to move from this room to the next room. You should become apparent, but if it's not, don't worry about it. I'll be here to let you know that. It's time to begin this room next room. Last but not least is we encourage interaction. Everything that you see in the space is okay. Amazing. It's crazy. Okay, cool. Touch, eat, drink, whatever you want. Excellent, alright, thank you. Okay, you should be in the lobby. Yeah, lobby main, so long since. I'll show you what's in there. Here we go. Let's see. Nothing in your sense? No, not yet. Oh, there's a hand. Okay, yes. Yes. A window. Yeah. We do. Yeah. Nice one, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, I was going to call you tonight. So it doesn't have to. Right? So where do you want to go, French, Italian, Chinese, or just slumber to pick a burger joint? Let's go to the burger joint. Okay, I don't know where the burger joint is. I'm going to go to the burger joint. It's not far from here. It's just a few blocks down. Okay, let's go. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Oh. I told you about that new job. Sorry. I told you about that new job. Sorry. The publishing house. The head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. I might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and a cross, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur and the access to it. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls on the floors on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little goombas there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean it's just the job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression if you want. Hey, do you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Yeah, it looks good. Looks good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe two or 70s club? Is the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Jan O'Jack's. The audience. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total mess. That sounds like a blast. I could use a night out. That's why I'm going for this. What's the plan? Are we meeting up with the others there or at the restaurant first? Hopefully. I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one the gate applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful. Like a cross between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Did I tell you about what happened on the first date? I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers. They were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... What's an age in? In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow they'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get in word in age racing then. Oh Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. And I'm in Gersville at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and creative intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So why at least to go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole team knocking at someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them so I had to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the major D and so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. Say it! Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to step and do something different. Maybe I just... ...and we'll try to go. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Completely. Mom, don't be scared. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Okay. What are you doing over there? Come here. Got a letter? Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put your all you to bed. There's questions to speed up I'm sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I'm pretty milleted at last week training. I'm going to begin with and you're crushed. By the time she's on the line so she won't be able to join us. I know I know where so herself. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. By the time she's on the line she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. My music is taking off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes... ...I'm not going to be able to do it. Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look. Everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...it's a bit of a favour. I always burst those coming up later this month. People don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. It's a message that you know about whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. See what he was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen and strip the paper. You can pin them on that board. It's like you could do this. But I don't really know where they are and where they came from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Henri, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was already... ...he runs me being with my sister, Lizard. There she is. You know, Pitch. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' thought. And that place was like... Well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave the aching and the leave behind. The come of the people. Live otherwise. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic cave round. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... ...straged, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carfatic, completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etching stones that can't be lost, right? And hold the master of the lake, is he? Just to set. I go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, give me a break. It's two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a lab to make a decision, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Two days of kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I hope people will arrive soon, so... No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Speak. Fifth! Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I heard a lot. You're looking for your fighting over custody. Yeah. But I wouldn't know what to say either. Something's just... Don't have any answers to that. Things are just... You know... Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... Wow. Okay, you've dropped that. I mean, did you at least hear the part I made a good point? No. It goes... I can't hear what you're saying. You're lips are moving, but I can't hear what you're saying. No. No, I still can't hear you. I'm sorry. I can't hear what you're saying. I'm sorry. There's no voiceover. There's no dialogue coming out. Can you hear the rain? Yes. Can you hear the rain? Yes. Can you hear the rain? Okay. And he's talking with you on this new campus. Yeah. He's lips are moving. He's looking at me. But I can't hear his... Yeah, that's... The last thing he said to me was your eavesdropper. Yeah. And then... Yeah. I'm assuming you still read on your own. Yeah, still read, yeah. So I know what you're wondering because it's the end of your heart. Everything else, so it's fine. Okay. This is a new book. Okay. This is a new book. Okay. It's very good that it should come to me very soon. How are you? You can see if he says something like that. I'll be in the basement. I'm trying to get the internet to a location that's going to be in the room. He looks very sad. No, except... No, he's not talking though. He's just breathing heavily. Okay. So let's try this really quickly. Sure. And then we're going to... Can you press quit and that? Okay. And then on the sidebar, the U button. Yeah. That should bring you... Back to the lobby. Yeah, unreal engine. Yeah. Over, yeah. It's turned to black. And now lobby main, yeah. Okay. Let's see. This should bring you back to the same scene. Okay, it's just gone to black. And... Yes. Things are in different positions, but we're... Back. Things are in different positions. Oh, shit. So the bear is there, the violin is there. Okay, cool. No, it'll be a little queer. Okay, cool. Because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been... Gee, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Gee, today's will kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I hope people are riding so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll clean. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Fifth. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Everything. You're fighting for custody. Silent judgment. Love that for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some smartos and put it go all then. It's a tough battle, you know. Just trying to make sure Ori knows I'm always there for him, you know, no matter what happens. Messing. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Ori is there for me. I'm pretty sure Ori is there for me. That's nice. Messing. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. And to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see Ori that often. You know, especially with Tori and all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But... Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took Ori to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell... I'll take him with me. We've never been to the US because all his Christmas has came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downpire. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And... I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat, I caught side tickets at the nap today. I loved it. The screenfamous does also have that. And we stayed up late for the shows. We had to go to the gym and do more and see more. And I've been you. I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Good rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. Memory. What's the one thing you think you'll never want to forget? I mean those moments that really stick with you. They shape who we are, don't they? My kids cut me. The memories they weave into the fabric of our lives, don't they? Absolutely. Kids. I'll tell you about the thymacic I weighed in your. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Where is she? Please. No, please. Please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're an idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. They. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I'm sure you're aware. Could you, uh, would you help me find them? There could be in the bookshop. Or, or in the cabinet. I found them now. Or all the drawers. Or, or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing now. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I've always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. Oh, that was scary. I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. I've been recording of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Bylett the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, it is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. When I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know we immediately had a response, but you'd already started talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you're all demeanor. Shipped it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I had to completely and consequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. From? Yeah, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first day, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And for you, I'm a fool. What's wrong? These guys said she's lost this wallet. It's true, and my day is going to come back here, and then you're in it, so please just got me some slack. I swear I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. Do you think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. I'm a David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainer for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and Prosecato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trick on Grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it away. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. 3aM ‚âÇ ‚âÇ√ºyorsun to begin at my manga. ‚âÇ Don't you play with 5xius now? Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and your wrong dish, do you know? Alive by the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed, now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fate, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. Alora strones by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? He says more locked up than a mob account in witness protection, and we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's, he's a Craig Fender now, he tests this big man, all those oranges, practically not for Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. You're a parlor trick, son, your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away, slide. You know the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Mad o, na, ma, give me a finger. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go in. That's as far as we have. Oh wow, wow, wow, my goodness. Congratulations.\n",

      " When you use the table, make sure that you hit it properly, rather than scratching on it. And then last but not least is, feel free to roam, touch, taste, eat, drink, whatever you find. It's the best way to put it. There we go. So I'll put this on here. Right. And then just put it up a little bit of the stroke. Is it? There we go. There we go. That's good. It's good. Yeah? Yep. Then just tighten it. There we go. Small head. Okay. All right. So. Are you in the living? I see a black screen. You see a black screen? Mm-hmm. As in, it's just dark black. There's nothing there. That's me. Is this fished off? Probably. Yeah. I think I could load it. Yeah. There we go. Yeah. We've reached the Garfield Catomac for answering. Door. We're at the side of the brook. Leave your name. Shops. From the number of canned shoe size. I swear you know, it's not. I've been told that the population has. You know, overall crowds, but remember, you do still need to call them once in a while. I'll call you back. You're in Christmas. Maybe you would love him. Oh, I'm not think. Can you remember that? Just take it a shower. Okay, okay. Do you want to meet him yourself? Thank you. Make yourself at home. I'm not calling you. Whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. I'll be gone. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. I'm not going to work on my high pitch. I'm not going to work on my high pitch. I'm not going to work on my high pitch. I'm not going to work on my high pitch. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway. So it doesn't really matter. So where do you want to eat my shank? We could do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. Burgers. Burgers it is. Sometimes you've got to embrace the grease and go all in. Fries aren't me. Sure. I was thinking we could try that new place downtown. Herd their fries are amazing. I'm starving. Let me just grab my jacket and we can head out. Okay. By the way, we need to catch up with John and Mike. They're already waiting for us. Do you talk to them about what happened yesterday with the band audition? No. I was too busy. That's okay. We can fill you in on the way. It's a pretty cool story. Oh, and by the way, I got some news about my job that I want to share with everyone over lunch. Okay, sounds cool. It's kind of a big deal, so I think you guys will be stoked. Let's get going. I'm really hungry. And we don't want to keep the others waiting. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning and just incite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. So she needs to trip her cupies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the...copy room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be a little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. Got gumbed scared of little gumber to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types in suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the ju-box is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down, and I'm thinking, I screwed you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. Like I've killed it. And make this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was hobbitting in like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, smiling at me. Smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And our household. That was it. They fired me on this talk. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression if you want. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch, but I'm not sure. Do I speak? Yes? What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Yeah, the leopard print is a choice. I know. I know. It's a bit much. But the girl I'm meeting tonight said she liked it. I'm going with it. It's giving off 1997 King of Prom Reject Bards. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something neutral. Hopefully, I actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gay tech side. And she's just really cool. She's stunning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So I tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up writing to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I look like, I don't know, a cat that just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really do anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have in compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow they'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G-Knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but... fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes viral at the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking... about architecture and... her creative intent when she's designing and... the music she likes and... how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... tell her what was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. So, violently used to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise... I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate... someone's over the matri-day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me. So, I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees... just as Violet walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major day. And so, somehow... I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I've got this... this thing. Oh my gosh. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I should work on it. I'm going to go. I don't know what's going on. I mean, I like it, but... When's this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean... It's only after doing it. No? Tell your friend from the girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just going to do this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... Just stop and do something different. Alright. I'm trying to go. Okay. So... Hmm. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? He watches all the way to the vontade. Ambassador Bucheninner I'm using this thing for that which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you get a long enough tightly on first aid to keep calm already anyway but everything's right because it is already easy raising so best day of my life after that it's not I have this idea I wanted to do too well it's a bit of a pain on me I was very interested in it and I was thinking about how people that really don't know where to put your tears in their lives I wanted to create something physical about it but keep saying from this point on it's just I wanted to find a message it can be what I do right it doesn't have to be a message I think it's better to assume it's not about whatever right you know what we know now or what we should know now I think we could be talking about it no no so from a time I used to put my hand up you could feel the moment more than I think you could feel it I think you could feel a moment I don't really know what they are you could feel it from there you sort of wait but I spent time it always I was wondering if it was my job you know, it feels like a dog it made me realize what the poor old man never did he knew that I was not thinking about his ability that's it he knows how he plays his part and how he's a farmer and he's a farmer that's a piece of us but it's something I think something like or whatever we were later these 18 and 25 people just I'm not a kingdom, a dragon, a castle. And because it just felt so much, it just tried dancing to pay around. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be. One day they got lost about that. We had a path, but we always talked to get in and out. And she just...strange, I guess. It's the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found where they were pretty, pretty good things. But it felt like an eternity in time. And I was younger and younger. You know, real sense of consequence of that age. What it means, I should use something, but... But I think it's easy. It's how easy it is. Use something that you love. I guess that's why I wanted to have something to do. Something permanent. I should have stood and come lost, right? A whole...the master of the way, is it? You know, just to say. I guess you should have been here. Is it something? How you doing, your friend? True, true. When you wereeteed, it was still loud and dirt. Two days later, just two days the small big small container. Good amount. That's great, my friend. I'm glad you're hungry. We're going to grab some food to eat today. I don't know how to say it. What? I don't know if I can handle it. What's with your face? Yes. I'm trying to be at the spot. And make it work in the grimly, in the situation. I don't see all of it. Especially the focal point. Both. Both. I don't see all of it. I don't see all of it. I don't see all of it. I don't see all of it. I'm approaching it a little more complex. But my list is just here like that. Who's I live? Everybody's got the time of the origin of your mind. We love you. I live now. I'm going to have to show you. There's no last minute. Because it's what the hell is. I'll take you with me. These little things perhaps a wall it could have been. Everyone. It's there. And the only function that will zone across the spots which in spite of the campus walls, that actually would be.... Do you guys see this? Which is then four or five hours and.. Maybe it will be... A covenant in my mind. The Witness. You know, I was just thinking about this the other day. What's the one thing you'll never want to forget, my friend? The feeling... My friend. Hello. Can I answer the question? What's the one thing you'll never want to forget? Yeah, go ahead. That sadness is temporary. Are you okay? I'm alright. Just being on my mind a lot lately. Things with my son, Auri, and this trip to New York. What trip to New York? We're planning to go somewhere, well at least I am. I'm trying to convince him to come with me to be here for us, you know, all the meantime. Cool. Please, I'm coming to help you. No, no. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember it. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, no. No, no, no. Why, why is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Thing. Do they? No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the past you have to. What do they think? They are very foolish. Those fools! Take some of them to here. You with your love. Of course they're not. Idiot. You blithering idiot! You never let them see Oh, is he? Sorry, I didn't mean to come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You call her what? The same age. Seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed a wry, he was just here. He's helping me try to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me try to find my glasses. I need them to read it not so. There's definitely in here, I'm serious about that. I just don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could be in the book shop. Or in the cabinet. Or all the drawers. Or in the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? Or the piano. Don't think it's in the cabinet. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I've been writing my memoirs. I've been writing my memoirs. I'm doing everything I need to do. They always do this. I did a few of the time I lost my history with the college. I was scared. I am aware of not what I have been getting to. I've been getting to see the boys. I was so scared. I was so scared. I was so scared. I was so scared. I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. I was just about ready to call the clips when you find them in the rush day. It was funny. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. I was so scared. I was so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. That was a mistake. I was so sorry and I'm Chris. I was touched by it. I was going to be a stranger. It seemed so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. I didn't know we had a response. I started talking about the music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me or shit, it. It wasn't peeking behind a curtain or something. I just met. There was such openness about it. I thought it was intimate. Like, you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sideway into the story about your sister and many. And how it just tore your family after she passed away. And how it just tore you. And that was just... ...nam struck and Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first date, I usually only involve small talk. I never remember thinking, you're such a great reason to be a guy. And then I actually went into the childhood and took your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think... I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and... ...a bit completely a consequential staff. And you just... ...you know what I'm saying? Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little funny, but by the start... I already knew I wanted to meet in the game. Like the house, the garden, the child. Like getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later, you went to stop paying to make up for the inlay. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Burmer? Oh yeah, I got it. I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, but I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she has a lot of wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late. And I insist on paying before she went to the bathroom. So she goes back here. This. I should have taken the food. Please. What's up, Shay? Please, I said you brought food for me. It's true. And my day is coming back here, and then in a minute, please just get me some slack. I swear I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. We have the policy that, no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And for this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. So, wow, that's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your wine? Oh, you've got to read it. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're thinking of the company, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. Seriously, I'm privating you and leaving over the bracelet and well. And clearly, you don't believe me anyway. So, what if you have to lose at this point? Love, being, love, being. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. A wish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. You're only not to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and you're. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You're strong and slick, but scenes don't hold a colon gene over key. Like it's played in gold and post-cato pizza. Lens with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. A. Pretty. My eyes are sore. I don't want to get to the end, but I'm really sore. Sorry. Cool. Very good. And so, you know, it's, you know, four to two minutes or five. Yeah, oh, god. 55 and 12. Well, 51 right now. I'm going to be able to get to the end. I'm going to be able to get to the end. I'm going to be able to get to the end. I'm going to be able to get to the end. I'm going to be able to get to the end. Cool. Very good. Alright. Okay. Okay. Let's do one.ÈÄÄ.–µ—Ö. Okay. Okay. Great. Any possible step? Yes, one more. Okay. Ohh. One more. Quick Good. Okay.\n",

Yeah. The response? Wow. You're really just going to let me go out like this, huh? Thanks a lot. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day, too. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between broke shields and Jennifer Connelly. And she's just really smart. So I'll tell you about what happened on the first day. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, I thought, oh, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's just Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... It starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and the creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up, and just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this skill is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so... Why, at least, to go to the bathroom. I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks that I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky guy, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So, I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possession to have on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of god, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks back in, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. And so, somehow... I had to get out of there. So, surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. I've seen that expresses what's shetch for me and it just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... Ha! Tell me how to do it. Tell you a very friendly, a girl friend, or husband, or wife, what actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... Just step and do something different. Maybe I'm just... Alright. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Come on. Okay. That's it. That's it. That's it. I'm sorry about that. Hi. I really wanted to tell you something. I'm sorry about that. I really wanted to tell you something. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Liada o'r daall dirad o cym bad eyeshadow a?

I stayed up late, the show's good. It was him dragging me out bed in the morning. If he wanted to go out and then he'd do more and see more. And I've been you. I met some father. And we didn't have much of a relationship, we left. But I want to worry to know what he needs to mean. I want in time memory to look upon me. Not just the rock star father that was never there. I hope the time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think it's those moments that shape us. You know? Time with your kids. Absolutely. Those fleeting, precious times with our children, they become the threads of our memories. Stitching together who we are. It's an incredible journey, watching them grow and realizing. We're growing too in different ways. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those moments, they're like snapshots in time aren't they? I often find myself reflecting on them, cherishing the laughter and the lessons, feeling grateful for every shared experience. Yeah, me too. It's like each memory is a brushstroke on the canvas of our lives, creating a beautiful picture over the years. I just, I want to hold on to that, you know? I don't know. Please. No, please, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think. Do. They. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the past, you have to. Stay far. It's safer there. Where are they? Where are they? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think. Do. They. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the past, you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari, he was just here. He was helping me to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm so tall of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshop. Or in the cabinets, and I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I was... Oh, cheer, that is embarrassing up. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Good and smooth. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult, because I'm losing everything. I've always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest and used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Or... I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. Oh, recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Bylett the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there, and I started to worry that you wouldn't actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late, and although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. And I was always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. I had this complete stranger who'd seemed so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling, and I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you don't already start talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it, and it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation side-wayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away, and how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck and Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates, I usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy, and then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braving up myself, and then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work, and I had a completely inconsequential staff, and you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but my dessert... I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you assisted on paying to make up for being late, so I excused myself and went to the bathroom. But... I got him really sorry, but I seemed to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear... What about your late friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom, so if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. These guys said she's lost his wallet. It's true, and my date's gonna come back here, and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle it. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one, and it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a tree-horse meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? La Bain√©. La Bain√©. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out this. Abish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. But why not to be dangerous? Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll in sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and prosketo pizza. Lens with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean. And you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You wanna read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm not gonna lose. I'm not gonna lose. I'm gonna lose. Lindies with flair options. You bolÂìé check that sign.

      " So welcome to the space. In the funnel piece, you will actually be outside. We will prep you outside and then as you enter the room and you enter the room into this, probably the account for it over there. So, we'll start here. Couple of things are going to do. When we start, I'll be in the room. And I need to make sure that you see a door, a window and a bookshelf. Once that's in, I can get out. There were two. Some moments you're going to see a green line or a red line. Green line means you can speak. Red line means you can't speak. As we say, always let him finish before you start just because we're in a basement with the internet. When you speak at this level, you don't need to shout because then he won't hear you ever. The first part of the experience happens here and then at some moment you get asked to move to the other side. Once you move to the other side, you stay there for the rest of the experience. I'll make sure that I'm here, just in case you don't understand when to move. When you use the table, make sure that you hit it properly. Don't scratch it. Try to give it a nice little touch. And finally, we reward people that explore. Excellent. Reward with. With this, you can take the phone. There you go. Let me know if that's good. That's good there yet. Perfect. Okay. Just a little bit to show. Perfect. And a little bit to show. Perfect. And a little bit to show. Can you track the door there? Here is the door. There is a window. And reach the Garfield Catomatic Annas Book Service. Felt the sound of the burp. Leave your name, phone number and shoe size. I actually don't. I don't think you'll get the cup of hip-hop. You know, we're all proud, but remember, you stay still. You need to pull that one through one. I might feel bad if you're a person. You need to be careful. Pull it on one of the ways. You need to be careful. Okay, okay. I want to be in your arms like this. Thanks. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Prevac off you. Whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Drink on a big gun. On the red. I'll reach. Just two seconds. Oh, man, I'm really sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but since we're eating out anyway, what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Oh, um, burgers. Let's go for burgers. Wow, I can't believe I let it get this messy. It's a bit of a mess. I'm going to have to go to the grocery store. I'm going to have to go to the grocery store. Wow, I can't believe I let it get this messy. It's a bit of a surprise, but I guess that means we'll have to pick something delicious to distract from it. Oh, yeah. Hey, hi, haven't seen her. Yeah, let's eat. That's a relief. I mean, who doesn't love a good burger? It's like the ultimate comfort food. I didn't expect it to get this out of hand, but sometimes life just surprises you. Right? A good burger sounds perfect for this kind of day. Burgers it is. There's something about sinking your teeth into a juicy one that makes everything else fade away. Can't wait to dig in. Great. Let's go. Should we start now? Should we have a now? It's funny how the simplest meals can be the most satisfying. Let's grab those burgers and make today a memorable one. Absolutely. The sooner we get to those delicious burgers, the better. I'm ready when you are. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. But gumba is sending me to the...copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gumbed scared of little gumba to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling for me back in office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm aligning the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. Then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no ink. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was halving it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door. I'm starting to feel a bit chilly. Did you like it? Now I'd like to recite another song that I wrote. It's just called, girls just want to eat cheese. Oh, mommy dear, you know that I need to eat from the four basic true groups every day. That's right. Girl just want to eat cheese. Oh, girls, that's all they want to do. Girl just want to eat cheese. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? Yeah, sure, you look great. No, no, it's a little tight. I appreciate that. Just trying to stay warm and look decent for tonight. It's funny how these things happen, right? Sometimes, just adds to the excitement that they look too good and your Janssen buys that out. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one day to get applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like. Across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Did I tell you about what happened on the first day? I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up writing to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just cooled out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian in Rocky. It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have in compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in age raised. Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some g knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash until it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so why not at least to go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky guy, someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major day. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. Maybe I just... Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. That's the path. I'm scared. You know? I'm scared. I'm scared. What are you doing over there? You may use your –±—ã—Ç—å in that shop and lock your Matsusias on your bench! Oh Hey Sorry about that I I really wanted to meet you all but By the night I'm pretty militant of our sleep chaining and going to the game with them. We got crushed By the sends a love she's on the deadline so she won't be up the join us and I know I know worse her as ever just Juggling a bit of stuff and then By the camp harder and she's under a lot of pressure She and I were Like ships in the night My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously sometimes Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of already anyway Everything's great Really is Ori He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day It's mad Look I had this idea I wanted you to well It's a bit of a favor Always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how People don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives And I wanted to create something physical by Keep safe from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message It can be whatever you like it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know About whatever life You know What you know now or what you wish you'd know that I Think it'd be really cool for money's older, you know See what was around him when he was a baby So rather than a slipper paper you can pin them on that border Thank you for doing this I think it's gonna love it. I don't Really know what they are doing from It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ori and remember things from my childhood You know things like the dawn It made me realize What a temple thing memory He's roaring He wants me being with my sister Gash is not pitching She and I used to play in this forest behind our family home this was the former parents thought And that place was like Well Sacred to us in this weird kind of way I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people live otherwise Because we were kids, right? so We're actually living in our imaginations of that we'd invent whole kingdoms dragons castles and Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous One day really got lost of that We had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just Straight I guess It was the worst thing I've ever experienced I mean I Think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age What it means to actually lose something that day Carried it completely Just how easy it is to lose something that you love I guess I It's interesting so it can't be lost right? Oh the master of the wake is he just to set I go see to them maybe you can meet him isn't too grumpy Hi, hi there little buddy Daddy's here Oh Can me a break miss two days it's not a big Viler it's shared custody But I hardly get to see him as is No Time with my son it's not actually the end of What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been Jeez listen to yourself for a second will you? No, you don't understand violet.

Things are just you know Massie I'm trying to To be a good father To make it work in a pretty shitty situation I don't see all either No Especially with Torin all the time Well I'm approaching it a little unconvincially that violet just went to you like that I Did I ever tell you about the time at the origin you got he loved it We only had a couple of shows and It was very last minute but I figured what the hell I'll take him with me We've never been to the US because I all his Christmas. It's came at once and There were some small shows small Acoustic Swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity I knew we'd have some down pipe And we spent all that time together me and him Explore the city And get Korean food for the first time I Took into the sleep no more and until the mat are caught side tickets at the nap thing Love that Just being famous does also Stayed up late the shows but it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more Another new I meant my father And We didn't have much of relationship after he left but I want to know what he needs to me I want him to have memories that it looks upon fun. You know not just the the rock star father that was never there Half the time I think that's all that they are I'm right What's the one thing that you would never want to forget I think it shapes who we are doesn't it? The one thing I would never want to forget Wow to remember is my father's love. It's funny isn't it?

So That they're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just I don't know where Could you Would you help me find them They could be in the bookshelf Or or in the cabinets found them there before Well all the drawers On the sofa Well, or maybe under the table Um, how about the chair I don't think they're in there, but Or the piano Or the plant I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful Oh Yeah, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket Good I've been writing my memoirs That was just difficult because I'm I'm losing everything things Who always did that Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in oh that was scary I am aware I'm not what I used to be I've been getting people to tell me boys notes the recordings of what they remember I got this one from by look the other day. It's the dumbest thing God did this is so embarrassing that here it goes It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean When it met you at your gig you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible And we didn't have cell phones back then so I couldn't just ring you to check Then finally this young man bustles into the restaurant But it wasn't you remember I had only seen you with makeup So I wasn't even sure what you look like without the big hair and the outfit and if I'm honest I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in And it was funny because you weren't cool at all you were so freaked out by the fact that you were late And although I didn't know this yet. This is because of who you are Chris Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain Obviously, but well, I mean I'm just really sorry and on Chris And I was touched by it How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing But now dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling And I didn't know immediately how to respond but You don't ready started talking about your music and it was Sort of incredible like Your whole demeanor Sheptid It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone We just met There was such openness about it It felt almost intimate Like you were completely and afraid to show me yourself And then the conversation is segue into a story about your sister Lily and how it destroyed your family after she passed away and How it destroyed you and I was just Thumbstruck Chris Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up About the things that have affected them the most deeply Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk So I remember thinking oh my god, there's such bravery to the sky Then I actually wanted to reach out and Take your hand I wasn't brave enough myself and then I think I think at that point you might have actually made a joke But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention So I didn't know whether to laugh or not But then I started talking to you about my work and Other completely and consequential stuff and you just Listen Like you really wanted to hear and I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert I already knew I wanted everything with you Like the house the garden the child Like getting old together I wanted all of it And later you insisted on paying to make up her being late So I excused myself and went to the bathroom Robin I Yeah god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear what about your lady friend surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well No, please this this was our first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom So if she comes back here this I shall think of a fool please But you are a fool Geno What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet It's true and and my day is gonna come back here and then in a minute So please just got me some slack. I swear to god I'll come back tomorrow and settle them I die We have that policy that no, no listen listen to me. I'll give you my watch but I'm aware of one and uh or this bracelet it was it was my grandmother's And it's the most important thing I own it's not like I just jump here and then leave it Wow, that's what you're going with you think that's gonna cover a tree cause meal And the wine don't forget the wine and the wine Okay, wait wait what if what if I told you I can read your mind Oh you gotta be kidding that's how you're gonna play this Oh, yeah, it's how you gonna play this I can do it Let me show you way to say and wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh?

      " and see this place but obviously coming in because obviously there's no door. A couple of things to know. You're going to see a green or red bar. When you see the green it means you're allowed to talk. When you see red it just means you're not allowed to talk. Okay. You should say let him finish his phrases before you say you also. Okay. That's because I'll let up on. Number two, at some point you're going to move from this room to the next room. Hopefully it will be understandable when it is to move. Okay. So then you stay in this room. Okay. At the beginning of the piece I'll be here with you just to make sure that you see a door. Okay. A window and a bookshelf. Okay. And then last but not least we reward people that explore. So you're allowed to grab, touch, eat, drink, whatever you want in this place. Okay. All right. So can I? Okay. Put it on. And then let me know. Thank you. Here? Here. Perfect. Okay. So let's see. Okay. No. Is the door is right there? Sorry. That's exactly why we ask. Yeah. Because otherwise it just throws everything a facilitated way around. Do a little. Let me restart the headset just in case. Okay. Okay. I just made the boundary on this one. So I want to make sure that that's correct. Okay. Try this. And if it doesn't do it, I must reach the head to the right. Okay. Okay. Anything happening? What? Is there anything happening? Nothing. No. I mean the lobby. Is there any more? I mean the lobby. But there is nothing. I can't hear things in my headset. I don't know why. Okay. Let me try and go. Sorry. There's an issue with this headset again. Let's go to the recording. Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. Okay. Yeah. Door. Perfect. Window. And the bushel. Perfect.

You're like the brother I never had. That's a bit unexpected. I thought everyone had their favorites. But it's awesome to see such an open-minded approach. Hmm. Someone... Call you. It's surprising, right? I guess it's nice to know that not everyone has to stick to a specific plan all the time. I didn't see that coming. It's kind of cool to think we can just go with the flow and enjoy whatever we end up choosing. Oh, sorry. I wasn't... Yeah. Hmm. No worries. What did you say? I don't know. I don't know. Don't put this on your tape. Don't put this on your tape. Whatever you do, don't put this on your tape. Hmm. I want a new dog. One whose name is Bob. One who will fetch my paper for me. Oh.

Yeah, it's just something that we're looking at. I'm sorry, I thought it was my, but because I didn't know how to resolve a thing or something. You were thinking you were okay. It's just being in the basement down here. There's very little connection to the internet. Of course, yeah. I'm sorry, I've got that. I'm just going to, you see the menu.

The whole point. Okay. Yeah, it's just, it's timed in a way and then if it gets an impulse, it just keeps waiting basically. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. Great. You reached the Garfield Cato Maddox answering service. At the sound of the birth, leave your name, phone number and true size. I'm sorry, though, it's not. I have to go to the top of the screen now. You know we're all friends, but remember, you do still need to call those once in a while. You can't wait to hear all about it. You're in Christmas. You need to give it up to you. Or one more thing. Can you remember the different neck cake, guys? You want me to help you? Thank you. Don't put this on your tape. Don't put this on your tape. Whatever you do, don't put this on your tape. I want a new dog. One whose name is Bob. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just a drink or my beer. Take our one, big hug. Hello, Red. I know I need to work with my husband. Be nice and won't shed a lot. Just two seconds. Generally, a good companion for somebody who lives in an apartment. I want a new dog. I want a new dog. Hmm. Oh, whoa. Hmm. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up. But since we're eating out anyway, what do you think? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Oh, maybe some burgers would be fine. Maybe. Yes. You're talking my language. Wow, I didn't expect that. Burgers sound great. But it's surprising to hear you say that instead of something more adventurous. Hmm. I have a question. I'm not sure if I can get it right. I'm not sure if I can get it right. I'm not sure if I can get it right. I'm not sure if I can get it right. I'm not sure if I can get it right. I have a question. Do you know what is this? Sometimes a good burger is the best adventure. Nothing beats a classic, right? Yeah, it will go fine. That's a bit unexpected. It's funny how comfort food can hit the spot when you're not in the mood for something fancy. Hmm. Who would you... Yeah, if we're watching last year right now, this is a Nickelodeon. What do you see? Last year. Go back for help. Oh, there's a fire. Last year. That's not last year. It's a little bit... That's not last year. A simple... Close to me. I'm on fire. Close to me last year on fire. I could hope you. I'm just good old. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Oh, no, that's a shrap. You like the bread or... Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cup, these are the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, when the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. And then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the excess. So I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And a household. That was it. They fired me on this top. I mean, it's just the job. You know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Oh, can you see your jacket out there? I hope it's not too far. That would be a bummer. Hello. This is it. I think it's clear from the launch of that of calling you Friday afternoon of the 20th. This is my third call. We have a. What do you think? Great. Is it in a possible university, which is where this is the day? Yeah, it's great. Nice. I just don't want to look like I'm trying to try. I just think it's a bit of a university. And it looks like. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. We just need to make a better. You have a really bad history. Thank you very much for that. I actually stayed with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something neutral. Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time. I met her on the gate. She's just really cool. She's stunning to be an architect. She's funny and beautiful. Across between broke shields. And Jennifer Connolly. She's just really smart. They're talking about what happened on the first day. I was so late. Oh. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in a help criticise, I just saw my name and my plans for it and somehow they just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get in word in age raise. And then, oh Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke. And just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some g knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just, starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool. I can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land. So she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky guy. Someone's over the maturday. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matradite takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. So the matradite and so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. It's for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatch for me means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean I like it but where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you need to... ...to step and do something different. Maybe I just... Huh! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. It's great. Completely. Oh, sure. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. What are you doing over there? Come here. I'm just putting all these things. Keep walking? Okay. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I really wanted to meet you all. I'm putting a little bit of our speech training. I'm going to begin with and then you're crushed. I know I know words to her. She's struggling about stuff at the moment. She and I were like ships in a night. My music stayed off a bit which is great obviously. Sometimes you don't have long enough to take the old person in to take care of our music. Everything's great. He's amazing. I had this idea. I was thinking about how people don't have memories of their lives. I wanted to create physical bodies. It keeps safe from this part of existence. I wondered if you'd mind writing a message. I think it's better to say something you know about whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be cool for when it's older. See what was around him on the page. So, grab a pen and slip the paper. You can pin them on that boarder. I think you've been doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what the idea came from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orin, I remember things from my childhood. Things like the God. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. Among living with my sister, Liz. There she is. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former Paris Bar. That place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. We were like, yes, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. Live other lives. Because we're the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. We never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Liz got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. She just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that they... ...carrified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, can you see? Just a sec. I'll go see you too, then. Maybe you can meet him. He's in two from me. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Missed two days. It's not a big... ...violet, it's shared, custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, by the way. I'm actually a love maker decision, but I have plenty of single fucking details about you. Jesus, the things you're killed to see the world away again. But that's not fair. No. No, look, by the way. By the way, listen to me. I'll get on to kick this later. I have people who I haven't so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Bitch! Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I had everything, actually. It's strange how life shifts, isn't it? Just like moments we capture in memory, they can fade away or resonate by from around. Mm. Things are just... You know, messy. I'm trying to... to be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see how you're that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but I don't know. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the origin you got? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute, but I figured what helped? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas has came at once. And all shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time, and we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And get Karine food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mats I've caught sight tickets at the nap today. I loved it. Best thing for him is those options. He's been a late. He's been a few drugging me out, and he's been a few more. I love the new I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to know what he needs to be. I want him to have memory that it looks upon him, not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. What's the one thing deep down that you would never want to forget? I think those memories shape who we are, you know? Yeah, totally. I never forget. It's like... Sorry. There's a comfort in knowing that some things are timeless, right? I just hope that the stories I share will echo through time for him. Time has a way of slipping, doesn't it? I wish I could hold on to the good bits a little longer, you know? Yeah, I don't understand. You should tell him. Talk to him about that. The weight of those fleeting moments can be heavy. I often find myself wishing I could pause the best ones, keep them close, like treasures in a box. I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. I think I have the wrong decision. Probably. Definitely. Smart. She was. Always was. And of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. They do, they... No! Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Heh, of course they know. Idiot, you blitz me idiot. You never let them see. Think... Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry I hear. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. It's only me that's getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I'm looking for... I don't know where. I'm searching. I'm searching. Could you help me find them? Yes, sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Or the... I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. I'm so sorry. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is embarrassing. Here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. I started to worry that you might have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like there's a possibly cool young guy. So yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. We didn't have cell phones back then so I couldn't just ring you to check. Finally, this young man ustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally brushed it. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. This is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. I thought caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and on Chris. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. And now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know I knew I had a response. Yeah, you don't really start talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding a meter, shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got in your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first days have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to the sky. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really, I don't know, was it really paying attention? So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. And then I started talking to you about my work and other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady, friend? Surely she had lots of water as well. No, please. This was her first day, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. Are you a fool? Do you know? He says it must just want it. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a tree-cores meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah. Now she's going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah. I didn't realize I had a star. Maybe I could reveal him. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. But, right enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and slick, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and Prosecutor pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths. You can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it away. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming. But near the end. One wrong move. One mis-reply. And you're on dish-duty. No, alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet. And hold that grin. The plates are stacked. And soaps your sim. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. While I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me. I'm just Gino. I know the silo. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. In a hurricane. The last bites on a porcelain plate. The whisper mother mia. In your plague. In your plague. For. A Laura. Strongs. By a fan. Who? I am not a man. And I'm genome, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. We start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point, don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, like me, me, me, me. It's crack-panting now. Test band. Although all I see is on the north-western Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Pala tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know that there's anymore. None of this anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhaw nama. Gifigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Freak. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling. And I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. Thank you.\n",

Anyway, look, everything is great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. Ori's birthplace is coming up later this month, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of my physical thoughts. It keeps safe from this part of his existence, and I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever life. What you know now, or what you wish you'd known that, I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was eight. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are doing in Jane's Rock, but he's sort of weird. When I spend time with Ori, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporel thing in memory is. He, with Ori, reminds me of being with my sister, Middits. There she is. Not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parent's job. And that place was like, well, they're sort of saking to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours, whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people, live otherwise. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we literally got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for our own. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just a sec. I'll go see you, then. Maybe you can be a phasing tube, I'm thinking. I... Is that a little buddy? That is here. That is here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as if. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school, because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he'd been. Listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a love to make a decision for that. I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Judges' days are killed to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people who I have been so... No, I'll... Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Excuse me. Fidget. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about... My hair doll. That's an interesting thought. The idea of memories captured in something so delicate. It's like each strand tells its own story, doesn't it? Lies messy and I don't expect anyone to have all the answers. Things are just... You know... Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either often. You know... Especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventional. Violet just looks to you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I could owe you to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. Fidget bought the help. I'll take him with me. He never been to the US. It was like all his Christmas's came at once. There were some small shows. Small acoustic swats for the big bands. I like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And had Korean food for the first time. I took into the sleep no more. And to the mat. Of course I took it to the nap today. I loved it. I was just being fair. It was awesome. We stayed up late for the shows. It was him dragging me out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more. And see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon the family. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that they are. Memory. And spend your whole life chasing your dreams. Trying to do right for people and make a difference. And not to be an idiot. They want to be an idiot. They want to be an idiot. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think it's those moments that really shape us. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. Safer. It's safer there. Where, though? Where? She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. But of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They... No. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. I didn't hear you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I didn't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Yeah, I'm right. Oh, dear, that isn't barricading up. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I'm goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult, because I'm losing everything and things. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes, recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Bylett the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh, god, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the... Is that your stop? Yes. It's really weird. Oh, no. It's really, that's never happened. Oh, that's why. That is really odd. It's indecided that I should probably just run here, because I didn't want to be late. And that... That is really, really odd. What's the problem? I have no idea. Is the first thing that it happens? Oh. It was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this completes stranger. This is really odd. And basically, it... It changed for some reason from room scale to stationary. Yeah, I couldn't see it. Yeah, if you moved, you couldn't see anything, right? No, I could see, but the movie was not... The door was in the middle of the door. Yeah, just because for some reason, you moved to... To boundary, which was... This is really odd. Were you anywhere special at that moment? Just a... I was here. Yeah, just... The shadow was too much for it. Yeah, I was here. Okay, should I continue? Okay. Are you in the black right now? Yes. Okay, can I see? Oh, it's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. Look, this same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I'm good, isn't it? I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything in things. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Or... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, then here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rest into the restaurant, and you weren't there, and I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat, was only a word of me, of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates, I usually only involve small talk. But I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. What's up, chair? This guy says he lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a tree-cores meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I couldn't read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave Europe with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What have you got to lose at this point? La bene. La bene. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that sweet, but I've got depth, you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic, and proscato pizza, and proscato pizza, return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. So you know how to pierce your heart to pour melted dark brown in snow. Like in the brown market yeah, it's soft inside and dark grey. They're just like you were turned unemerged by Item B. Grap down thatÈáëÊòüÊµ∑Êµ∑Áì¶, they look at me forever and ever. That's Trump's mind.

Oh here's the sparking of velvet storm Snapping time with a twist repo Eyes on fire... Oh, it's a scent? i remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Freed. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, d'Oy, but you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. So, in a red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The candle and flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's it. Okay. Okay. Ah, it's just right.\n",

I really wanted to meet you all, but by the live, I'm pretty militant of our sleep training and we're going to the game with him and you're crushed. By the sends of love, she's on deadline, so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, hollys, other, we're just joking about stuff at the moment. By the way, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were, like, ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously, but sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of already. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. He's amazing. He's like, the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late to this month, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical about it. It keepsake from this part of this existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when he's older. I see it was around him on his face. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper, and you can pin them on that board there. Like you could do this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and the end of it. It's sort of weird. When I spend time in Oregon, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realise what a ten-poor thing memory is. He was already and might be being with my sister, maybe. There she is. And I'll pet you. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents part. And that place was like, well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and, whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and lily behind and become other people. Live otherwise. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We were in bed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so, like, this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I've never found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young, and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. It's an eternity in just stone, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't it? Just to set. I'll go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him if he's into Brumby. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. I think it might have frozen me. Yeah, yeah. I don't know if I could feel that. Yeah, I'm always. You could quit. I don't know if I could quit out of this. I don't know if I could quit. Which app is it? I just quit. You could already. So just take X. Yeah. X, V, X connections. Are you out of the app? I can see the home screen, but I still also see the forest. Did you have the quick button? No. Just the forest, for those of you. We have, we know exactly what this is. It's annoying. It's an element of a ram. Okay, and it's one of those really funny things that if you move at the wrong time as it's building the forest, it crashes. But the voice finishes because it's the lowest part of the ram. Yeah. But then it crashes the whole other thing. Are you streaming too? No, no, no, I'm not doing a single stream. So it's all just the amount of polygons that we're trying to push. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go back to it. Yeah. Yeah, in the lobby now. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not big. My life is shared, custody. I've never seen anything like this before, it's been very, very, very hard to get to see him as is. No, no. A few misses a couple days of school because I want to take him on talk and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the wood. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous.

      " And just say one two. One two? Yeah, good to go. And if you want to put it in your front pocket actually, just in case you sit down. Of course, yeah, yeah. Here you go. Okay. So, come with me. Come with me. Come on in. Let me just make sure that everything is... Of course, yeah. Okay. Well, look at our lucky. Unleaky, just go. Let's see. Indian Banks. Okay. Perfect. Before you put it on, a couple of things. I'll be inside here at the beginning. You should see a door, a window in a bookshelf. That's correct. Then I'll get out. Okay. The second part is at some point you're going to be asked to move from this room to that room until you feel this correct or if not, I will let you know that that's the time to go. But hopefully the story tells you when to move. You will see a red line or a green line. When you see red, it means you can't talk. When you see green, it means you can talk. So it usually means that you have to let him finish before you intro them. And then last but not least, we reward interaction. So if you want to grab things, touch things, eat things, drink things, the world is for you to... Cool, yeah, yeah, discover. Understood. Great. Perfect. Good. Perfect. All right. You should be in Lobby Main. Yeah, Lobby Main, yeah. Okay. So you see a door? Yeah. Window, yeah. Bookshelf? Perfect. Okay, did I put Revolution 100 is there, or is that number? I'll call it UP now? Make yourself here, oh, normally. If that's the‰Ωé level you could show it that they won't beatting your desired card. Good. They're all safe. So just think about that, yeah, good for every job you have got. Yeah, yeah, your own card must be... didistry shows disobedience I'm not ready. We have to see you in a minute. Just two seconds. Sorry I'm late. I'm late to clean up for the retail. So I guess it doesn't matter to you. What do you want to eat today? We have a few options. Do you feel like French or Italian or Chinese? Or just slum it and go for burgers? Let's go for burgers. Yes, burgers. Honestly, why is it in the term we're going to pick anything else? Yeah, now I think sometimes you just have to have a burger. Totally agree. Nothing beats a good burger every now and then. I've been listening to this new cassette tape with Bon Jovi. Have you heard their latest album? Slippery one wet. Yeah, big fan. They really hit the anthems. What do you think of it? What do you think of it? I love it. The whole album is really catchy. But I think my favorite track is You Give Love a Bad Name. It's like so energetic and fun. Man is good to see you, A.I. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I had a new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, Fr. Moria got. So there I am this morning. And little gumber, someone's made to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And as she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. The gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too god-gum scared of little gumber to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights of stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slick, Charlie Sheen types and suit are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up building the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. I don't know the copy room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office, so I'm freaking out. And I run down into the wreck room in the basement, and I'm running down into the boxy's playing a Joe Shdon was singing. I'm all lost in the soup market, so of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow I, I actually find it. And I'm loading up for the document, lining the number down, and I'm thinking screw you, Joe, summer. I, in Lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press Copy, and then Alarm goes off. And I'm just screaming on the front panel so it's low at me. So, I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. It's like I've killed it, and makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into Blair in the exorcist, and so I was warming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's firing paper out of his ass, and the lava sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like artics in a swelter sadness, and little Goomba's there, but she doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this spot, I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to knock myself and make an impression from once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door. Yeah, I can see it here. Do you want me to grab it for you? And what do you think? Is there any possible universe in which is she wearing this for the day? I think so, man, but you got to rock it. You got to wear it with confidence. Do you feel confident? Honestly, not really. I'm thinking about this day to day in my mind. Let me go out like this, huh? Right, a lot. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll let you look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the G-Tech Play. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like across between brought shields of Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Don't tell you about what happened on the first day. God, I was so lame. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so she's still sort of like a... What's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow I'd just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get in word in a trace, and then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking on stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and I just thought, oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... G-Knocky, or something equally ignorant, and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... just hot laughing. And so, I'm figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again, you actually met someone really cold, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I'd only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally goes by, let the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creativity, and when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up, and just... ...spell down. Thinking, my God, this gifil is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and told her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I regularly, so, while at least to go to the bathroom, and I am about to deal with it when I realise, I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, suns over the major day, and while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me, and agrees just as violent works by kin and I'm still my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace to the major D. And so, somehow, I had too much to get out of it. So, surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming to such short notice. Just... I've got this... This thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on my path. But what you do when... when you're mentally blocked... maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... when is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go. Yeah, talk with Job, like my dad says. I mean... HEAD! Tell me how to do it. Tell me a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or husband, or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just going to go to this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stay up and do something different. This... Huh! I'm going to try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, we'll look this guy. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. What? Why don't we try again? I don't want to... What? I don't want to... I don't want to... I don't want to... I don't want to. What are you doing? Come here. Yeah, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Sorry about that. Hey. I really wanted it to me or but I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh.Laughter. It's okay but I like working on it. I like it. Oh yes. Hi, nicer. Oh yes. Sorry. Hi. Follow my kr√≥ pet maker. F happy? like ships in the night. My music's taken off from it, which is great obviously, but sometimes sometimes I'm long enough to type the unpertinent to take care of Orin. Anyway, love everything's great. I'm pretty good at it. It's Orin. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's fun. I have this idea. I want to give you two. It's a bit of a pain. I always imagine those kinds of things, but I always think about how people don't really have memories for the first few years of their lives. I want it to create some physical part. It keeps saying that from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better to smile as soon as you know about whatever you like. What you know now or what you wish you know that. I think it would be really cool if it was older. It's not as much about what it's about. So, Robert has a slip of paper. You can pin them on that more than that. Thank you for sharing this. I think it's a good moment. I don't think you know what the eyes of your painful heart. So, wait. I expect to have it already. I don't know if this is a watch out. Things that forgot. It really, really likes what's up the whole thing about it. It's a huge already. It's like a real resistance. It's precious. It's your most famous forest behind a pharmacist. This was the former cancer. Not posted like... Well, sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours, whenever we went there, we believed that the aching underneath the height became a bit more people. Never the lies. because we were the kids, right? So, literally living in our imagination, we've been met a lot of kings of driving the castle. And, well, this is just not so like, just gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea of it like this. One day they got lost of that. We had a path that we always talked to get in and out. She just... strange, I guess. There's the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was going, you know, you have no real sense of consequence to the mileage. What it means to do something, but... Not that. Cloudfire, thinking. Just help me easily, and use something I've done. Against that's why I want to have something going. Something permanent. Edge interstellar, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the lake is it? Just to set... Go see to them, maybe for me, a visit to your property. Hi. Hi, that little buddy. How you doing? How you doing? Hey! Hey! Hey! Just checking these little fish on you. I think it might have frozen here. I could feel that. Give it one second. You could quit out of this. What's your name? Edward, which app is it? I just quit. You quit already? Just click X. X, rise and feed. X connections. I think that's... Are you out of the app? I can see the home screen, but I can still see the first. Do you... Do you do that? Do you have the quits button? No. Nope, still just the forest frozen in the country. What's it going to do? I'm just going to try to do this really quickly. We know exactly what this is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a... Are these things work? It's an element of... of RAM. Right. And it's one of those really funny things that if... If you move at the wrong time as it's building the forest, it crashes. Right, okay. So, but the voice finishes because it's just... It's the lowest part of the RAM. Yeah, but then it crashes the whole other thing. Right, right, right, right. You're weird. I know, because are you streaming to that? No, I'm not doing a single stream. Okay, but I'll get it all over the next one. It's all just the amount of polygons that we're trying to push. Okay, let's see. A little back to it. Try to put it in. Put it in. And... And... And... And now... And now we need the lobby. Yeah, and the lobby, no. So, you should bring it to the lobby. Yeah, and the lobby, no. So, you should bring it to the lobby. Yeah, and the lobby, no. So, you should bring it to the next scene. Yeah, yeah, perfect. Thank you. Well, Jimmy, I've been busy two days. It's not a big... By the... It's a big, full-shared custom to do. But I'm trying to get to see if I do it. No, no. So, if you miss it a couple days off school, because I want to take it on tour, and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the movie. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's being... Do you need questions to yourself, Chris? Oh, yeah. No, don't understand, Hyland. I'm actually a loudspeaker, but... But yeah, we still have what to detail about you. Jesus, those who killed us in the world, the way he gets. By the hustle, by the way. No. No, look, Hyland. Hyland, listen to me. Look, I... I'm not speaking this way, so I... I'm hoping for what, just... Come on. Yeah. Yeah, that's... Time. Speak. Bitch! Oh. Um... Sorry. I didn't... How much did you hear about it? You doing okay, man? I'm good, yeah. Just got out of the shower. Things are just... You know... That's it. I'm trying to... To be a good farmer. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know... Especially Victorian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventional, but... Violet just went to see you like that, man. Did I ever tell you about the time I was an oe to New York? I... Me... Loved it. We only had a couple of shows. There was no last minute, but... It was a good block of hell. I'll take you with me. There were never things in the US. It was like all these Christmases came once. And there were small shows, small, acoustic slots for the big bands that might be concerted. Exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downpour. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. And get carried through the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat. So I've caught sight tickets and then happened to him. Love them. The street folks does also love them. They stayed up late. The show. It was him dragging me out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and then do more and then see more. And I've been you, I meant for father. We didn't have much of relationship at pretty loud. But I want to know what he needs to be. I want him to have memory that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Yeah. Half the time I think that's all that we are. That's right. You know it's funny. As we're getting ready to head out, it makes me think, what's the one thing you'll never want to forget? Man. I guess it is family, dude. So if you can, you should try and spend more time with him. It's the little things about Auri, my son. Like the way he laughs. Family is everything. Speaking of which, I've been thinking about taking Auri on a trip to New York soon. You should, if you can. You spend as much time with him as possible. Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. I've just landed a new job. And it'll make it possible for us to go. It's crazy how fast they grow up. Seems like yesterday Auri was a baby. And now, anyway, we should get going. The others are waiting, right? What ages are you now? I'll tell you about the planet that I waited in your... Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not braving up to that. It'll be there, will it? Of course it will. If you look... Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. They... Note. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the past. You have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Then... Oh. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Well, well, I've found them there before. We're on all the doors. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I can sit there in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I'm sorry. Oh, dear, that isn't embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. That was just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest who used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me bush notes. The warnings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet to the dentist. It's the darkness thing. God, this is embarrassing. Here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually writing 15 minutes late. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I made you at your gig, you just seemed like this was a possibly cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting you didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bussled into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm clenest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously, by, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I thought I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and a sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I, I know, I didn't know him, he didn't know how to respond. But yeah, you don't want to be talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible, like, you're holding me there, shifted, and it was, it wasn't thinking behind the curtain itself. It just wasn't, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely in a fright to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story I thought was a sister, really. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it districed you. And I was just, dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just, it's just extremely aware that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. But yeah, I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough to myself, and then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke that I was still a bit so stoked by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really, I don't know, wasn't really being attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff, and you just listened. I really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by the start. I don't really know, I wanted everything with you. I think the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make that for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Rob? I got him, really sorry, but I seemed to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow to repay. I swear. What about you, baby? I'm sure the ship was a wallet. No, please. This was my first date, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, please. She'll think of a fool. Please. You are often. You know? What's that thing? It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then you minute. So please just get some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I... We have the policy, then. I don't know. Listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And this phrase, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I know. And it's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you got with? You think that's going to cover a tree-close meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, that's what you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So do you think you're being a cop of the fool, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I'd never stop. I'd be cop of the human. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so where did you go to lose at this point? La P√©ryne. La P√©ryne. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, but right enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainer for you tonight. This thrones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. I'm going to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now, or what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one mis-triplei, and your wrong dish, duty no, alibi, the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet, and hold that grin. The plates are stacked, and soaps your sand. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm, reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin. While I sit slow and drink it in. I'd been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a morw up out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I've saved you, note, day that I can count. From broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And this dare you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your ne'o, the same trash to her ray. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kendelman, John. I felt it in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia in your plah. I'd... A Laura's drones. By a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. Let it's your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. Once that. I'll need the object beside it. No skipping. And no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He's had more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we'd better hear him. Yeah, like me and anybody. It's great fun to know. That's good. Although I want to see someone out for the Nebraska. We're under the radar. Slide. Slide. Powered tricks, huh? You firmly must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind my coin last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know, I'm the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not an either. Which means this is your object. My dawn, now. Good for god, now. Oh, he's the sparking up velvet storm. Snapping time with the twist ripple. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked like you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Freight. Or everything. Burn yourself. And as people walking out, they were smiling as to why. They used to shook your head until they had been worried. I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out of you. Because you never believed that someone like me wouldn't show spending time with someone healthy. And we walked outside. You were red and yellow suns that covered the streets which were steaming up to the end. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diars, but... Nice, as far as we can. Okay. Interesting. Obviously you got towards the end or towards the middle. I should say. The thing about memory and living through his memories, and obviously he has... How sorry, is that the whole thing? Are you experiencing Alzheimer's through Ash? You're actually living through his memories. There's actually fits in between another piece that I made. I was told about his memories in Alzheimer's. Technically the last scene that you see happens a few years after when my last piece finished. That's why he's aware that he has Alzheimer's. Interesting. I'm going to put a different twist on it. When you realize he has Alzheimer's? Cool. America is quite tough. It's a... I'm honestly going to discuss this with you. It's home to a lot of people. I've had a few people that are divorced. I'm going to tell me. Yeah, I've fought my wife just for a game. The gates of crow. The animals is definitely just like emotional connection. You can get that. I'm trying to say that the animals in some ways... That's a real sad story. It's not really a mystery of the content. Things are not working. I think the narrative is small. I was quite surprised by the level of response. I can't say anything. You know, that's all they are. It's all they are driven. We have a moment. It was really funny. The first person ever to go through it. I mean, he goes to the store for the mess. He gave him a ball of king. How about the place being dirty? He's in our conversation with the place being dirty. And to the bench he goes, I got fired. Oh, sorry. I was just carrying a possession of mine. I'm going to make a shoot together. I'm going to keep the job.\n",

      " One two three, let's get it right. One two. Yes, one two, perfect. But you wouldn't see what we are right now. But because of testing, yeah, you get to see this space right away. When we start, I'm going to ask you to see if you see a door. A workshop. Okay. Yeah. A window in a window. Yeah, if that's correct, I'll get out of here. Okay. It's just to make sure that you're in the correct space. Number two, you'll see a, at some moments, a red or a green light. When it's red, it means that you can't talk. When you see a green, it means you can't talk. Okay. There's a little bit of a box still with the guy. So sometimes they just speak on top of him. You can get the little green. That's fine. At some point, you're going to get asked to go from this room to that room. I'll be observing and if it's something that's weird, I'll let you know. I'll be content to go. But hopefully, it tells you an entire story when you have to go. And then the fourth one is in this experience, will you reward exploration? Okay. So I'm free to explore. Free to explore, touch, eat, whatever you want to do. Okay. All right. It's good. Thanks. You should be the main lobby. Yeah, it says lobby, maybe. Yeah. Okay. Are we sure that's number one, guys? That's number one, yeah. That's one of six. There we go. There we go. There we go. I do see the door there. Window. Window. Window. Window. Window. Window. I do see the door there. Window. Window. Window. Window. Window. I'm going to enjoy. I'm going to enjoy. Whatever. Just a drink on my beer. You got a little bit of it. Just a little bit. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up but hey, we're eating out anyway. So what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese or should we just slumber and go for burgers? Oh, true Deal. I can't believe it. I was totally leaning towards some delicious tacos but I guess anything works when you're hungry. Quite true. I do love it. We should be connected because I was able to trigger it. He's not getting any he's been out there for a while but he hasn't said anything right? Yeah and the light was like tacos are hard to beat. Yeah. I don't know. I feel like the connection to that is being very slow. Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told the publishing house. I was like, well, the head of my department, Sarah, and no exaggeration, the woman is certifiably insane. She's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to sit at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariacar. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to her office and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed and how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip Charlie Sheen types and suit are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set put in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up with a document and I'm lining the number down and I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. It's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full in the blur in the excess distance. I was harboured to an ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. I was at our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with her. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. I know her household. That was it. They fired me on this talk. I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for you. Can you see my jacket out there? I feel like I might have left it somewhere. And I'm kind of nervous about forgetting it. Yeah, I do see it. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? Look at you, cowboy. Nice. Is the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Geno Jack. Be honest. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me. I appreciate the compliment, bad for just trying to get my style right for tonight, you know. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something unusual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one the gate applied and she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like a cross between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So I tell you about what happened on the first day. I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there and it started raining on the way like thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like I don't know a cat that had just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's her name? Adrian in Rocky. It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blivering at her. I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I could store my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone and I'll hurt to get in word and age raised and then. Oh Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just oh god it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it's just Italian place. I say something done asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron and she just starts laughing and so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? Probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally gets violent the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell it was fine to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late so violently used to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home and the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate someone's over the major day and violets about to come back any second now I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me so I've got no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering thank you to the major day and so somehow I had to get out of it so surely I got messed up twice in a row can I she's really special thanks for coming at such short OS I just I've got this this thing it's for violent she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that expresses what she actually means to me and I just I can't get it on the path what you do when when you're mentally blocked maybe I just show you what I've got I have this melody but I don't know I don't know where it's going I mean I like it but where is this leading sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says I mean I mean tell me how to do it you know tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I'm just maybe I'm just no good at this maybe that's it this is the universe telling me to just stop and do something different let me just try again what do you think maybe this come on come play with me come on don't be scared that's it that's it keep going keep going that's the path so I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. What are you doing? Just come here. I'll make you something. Oh, okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go there. Yeah. about that. I really wanted it to me but by the night I'm pretty militant about sleep training and going to the gym with them and got crushed. By the end of the month she's on their line so she won't be able to join us and I know I know worse house ever but just joking about stuff and then. Violet came part and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to type your person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late since month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical about it. It keepsake from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever, like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know now. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older, you know? See what was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than slip the paper, you can pin them on that board there. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are doing things wrong. It's sort of weird when I spend time at Orey. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-poor thing that I'm going to get. He with Orey, he wants me to be with my sister, little. There she is, you're not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' job. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etching to stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just to say, I'll go see to him. Maybe he can meet him if he's in too from there. Hi, hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big biler. It's a shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, by the way. I'm actually a love to make a decision, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail by you. No, look, by the way. By the way, listen to me. Look, I... I'm going to have to keep this place. I hope people are arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Oh. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Most of it. It's funny how time can slip away, isn't it? It's a lot for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some smartos and go all the way. Sometimes I wonder what memories we hold on to, from which ones, for you just... You know, nothing. I'm trying to... to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Both. I'm approaching it a little unconvincing, but... Violet just looks here like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took the old to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but it figured what the hell I'll take him with me. He's never been to the US because I all his crisps just came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. For I knew he'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And kept carrying food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and to the mat to have court side tickets at the nap. I loved it. History and things. The show's back. It was him dragging me out bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love a new I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. I have the time I think that's all that they are. That's all that they are. What's the one thing you think you'd never want to forget? I mean those moments that really define us, you know. That's a tough one. you love the dance? I mean actually love the part. I —èÊ¥ªbolissy. I'll tell you about the time I took out eating your. Yes, loved ones. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there, with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. And I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys' notes. The callings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh my god, this is embarrassing. Okay, but here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was a possibly cool young guy. So yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. This is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I thought I was touchified. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know I didn't know I immediately had a response. But yeah, you'd already started talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you hold a meter, shift it. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely on a phrase to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I thought your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. How it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all the other first days, I'm usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on my pay. And I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she had lots of water as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. She'll think I'm a fool. Please. Are you a fool? Gina! Got such hair. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here and then you mean it? So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Yeah, that's how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. I'm gonna say it. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? Yeah, and then realize that you're gonna be a couple of years. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This is Strongens. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick.

      " You'll see a green line or a red line on your visor. The green means you can talk. The red means you can't talk. Okay. Wait for him to finish before you talk. When you speak, you don't have to shout. You don't speak like this because otherwise you won't hear you. Everything happens in this room and that room. At some point you're going to be asked to move to that room. If it doesn't make sense, don't worry. I'll let you know. Once you're in that room, you stay in that room until the end. Okay. One more thing. When you're going to use this table, make sure that you hit it nicely. Don't be soft. Don't try to do this because that's not going to work right now. Okay. And last but not least, feel free to explore and touch into whatever you want. Excellent. No worries. Alright. Thank you. Is that good? Oh, that's good. Perfect. Okay. So a door? Yes. Okay. So a door? Yes. Window? Yes. Yes. The Garfield Cato Maddox answering service. I have to sound to the burp. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Oh. Nice to meet you. That was good. Thank you. So what's your name? The Garfield Cato Maddox answering service. I have to sound to the burp. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Just thank you to show up. What does mean about love? 10. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beard. 10. 10. I'm a big... I'm a big... I'm a loaded... And now I really need to work on my high pitch. But just do seconds. 10. I'm sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what do you feel like eating French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? 10. You see, we stuck in a wall. Come on, don't leave me hanging. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, come on, don't leave me hanging. What do you say we grab some food? I'm starving after that shower. Plus I have some news I want to share with you about the job. Who, what are you talking about? Nobody's stuck in a wall. Are you pulling my leg or is this some kind of joke? I can see your hands sticking out from behind the plant, but I'm not seeing you. And I can see a foot. Um... What the, how did you even get stuck back? Wait, no, don't go. I'm not going to leave you like that. Hold on a sec. Let me try and pull you out. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just as sight at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's, um, sort of, sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, uh, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So, there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the press she's under to get her current project completed, and how she needs to trip her goat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me, but gumber is sending me to the...copier room. Um, I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. I just fight on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gunned scared of little gumber to ask for directions, so I just start running from room to room, because I need that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. I'm just the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types, and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down, and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of that. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idle, and shit is coming in from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling from me back in office, so I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm as singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket, so of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it, and I'm loading off of the document, lining the number dials, and I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low, aim. So, I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full under Blair in the access system, so I was hobbitin' inked like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's firing paper out, it's our sendin', a alarm sounding, and it's staff rushing from the offices to see what's happening, and it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't say anything, she just stands there, smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it? They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, I don't know, just to knock mess up and make an impressing for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Yes? Should I take the jacket? Very nice. It'll do. It's a very nice jacket. It's a... I'm not sure if I'm talking loud enough, sorry. It's a very nice jacket. And... Mutual. Hopefully, I actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between Brooke Shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, I'll tell you about what happened on the first day. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up running to run there, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation even more. So, I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, I'll hurt to get the word in edge-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and the creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her own from the ground up, and just... spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner, if they just... if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks back in, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major day. And so, somehow, I had to go to get out of it. So, surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... When is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go. Get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... Ha! Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe not set. This is the universe telling me to... to stack and do something different. Wait, what's this? Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. That's really nice. Come on, let me scare you. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. That's it. What you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. All right. It's Much, much, much, much, tanto como en donces, siempre hasta morir. I'm sorry about that. I really wanted it to be normal, but by the end I had completely had to do it. I'm using it to take hold of a bit, which is great obviously, but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to type me up personally to take care of Ari. Everything's great. How was this baby? He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's my... Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps safe from this part of their existence. I was wondering if you've mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know, about whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for me when it's older. See it was around in my room, baby. So, rubber pen, a slip of paper, you can pin them on that one of that. I think it's going to work. I don't really know whether I'm here at any point. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ari. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple is. You're wrong. You must be being in my system. There she is. I'm not picking. She and I used to play this forest behind a family home. This was the former town start. That place was right. Well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave you and then leave behind. Become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic cave round. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. It was just strange, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually do something. And then we got that there. I can't find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it in stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the mustard lake is it? Just a set. I guess you can see it. Maybe you can see it from there. Hi, hi there little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a lab's maker decision but I'm wanting every single fucking detail by you. Gee, today's will kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No, no, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... You don't speak this way, sir. I have people like, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's the time. Speak. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. No worries. How much did you hear about? I'm all of it. Sorry. Are you okay? No need to be... What brings... Yeah, I'm fine. Just got a lot on my mind, that's all. Things are just... You know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... to be a good father, to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took away to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US, because I all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And Peckery food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, I'm caught sight tickets at the nap today. Love that. The streamfermist does awesome stuff. And he stayed up late for shows, but he was human dragging the hour bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I don't believe what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of relationship at the last, but I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Have the time, I think that's all that we are. Memory. Speaking of things on my mind, what's the one thing that you'll never want to forget? My friend. That's the one thing I never want to forget. Top question, huh? My trip to New York with Auri had something I'll always treasure. Wait, hold up. I've got some news to share with you. Why does it? I guess that says it all, wasn't it? I'll tell you about the time I took Auri to New York. Please, no, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... I don't remember where it is that you go. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you're blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... No, don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri, he was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no, that's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Could you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet, and I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry, I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I have them the whole time in my pocket. I couldn't sleep. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes, recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant, and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidelined into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable and left to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. But when I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I had completely a consequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted to read it with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. But I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I'm back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first day and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's that, Cheyenne? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. Please, just got me some slack. I swear to Gino, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-cores meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is... How are you going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfield is. Seriously. If I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior, yes, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This is your name. Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Calling Geno Key like it's plated gold and post-cato pizza. Lens with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You're a trash of smile. Trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Inside music. Under the neon sky my friend your actress charming but near the end! One wrong move. Only a mischievous 1x3 dou, a la la. Spend away my first game in the play. Your wife, your fiancee, your girlfriend. You drink and to get there. the moment spins you bluff too hard nobody wins so place your bet and hold that grin the plates are stacked and soaps your sin you play it slick but here's the twist one wink too slow one move you missed now look at you all at no grace a punchline wearing her perfume's trace you pranced in light forgot the stakes she saw the seam she knows the fake so pitch your charm reverse that grin hope she don't see the clown within but if she laughs and waves goodbye i'll raise a toast and watch you try you'll bow and blurt you'll beg and spin the lice it slow and drink it in i've been called many things a major date a mind reader a mood sculptor a miracle in soft souls but me i'm just genome and i but you can't trick the kindelman jar i'm velvet in a hurricane the last bite on a porcelain plate the whispered mama mia in your plight a lor Khere ANNOUNCER i'm genome spirit Great, just great. Sure as what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. Or we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. Once that, only the object is hidden, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. I would better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw. He's a great friend in now. He tests this big man, all that answers, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know, I'm the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. My the orna. Oh, get figada. Oh, it's that? I remember being so struck by how you looked when you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as a people walking out, you were smiling and asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me wouldn't enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. So no red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's it. There we go. I'm sorry. Thank you. I was quite around here then. I thought. Oh my god, that's a lot of work when it's not it's it. She's... You... Take this to... Where's that's the hope? I don't know. We're still waiting for it. We're still at the finish one scene. Which is the scene that goes after this. Okay.\n",

      " And you hooked me because I was crying like a baby. And then we met again that same year at whatever it was called at the time. The other day we chatted in New York, and we philosophized about embodiment, which is my obsession. So I love it to meet you again. I'm a big fan of your work. Well, let's see what you've got. I know, yeah, yeah. It's pressure on both sides. It's pressure on both sides. I'm not a bad person with one. OK, so a couple of things. In a perfect space, you would have actually been outside, and you would have walked in through the door into this place. But obviously, infrastructure. Yeah. I will be in the room at the beginning, just to check. Once you go into the world, you should see a door, a window, in a vote case. OK. That's the main case you should see. If you say that's correct, then I cannot. Because that means the room is hasn't moved. OK. We're having a lot of issues with management with this. That doesn't surprise me. Peek-o, peek-o, peek-o. Yeah. But we're too late to think about that. Yeah, I got us. I know I've been there myself. So a couple of things. At some point, you'd be asked to move from this room to that room. If it doesn't make sense when, don't worry about it. I will let you know. OK. You will have a red line or a green line sometimes and you'll talk on the headset. When you see green, it means you can speak. Oh, when you speak red, it means you wait. That you have to wait. Yeah. You should be say let him finish before you talk. Just because we're in the basement, the internet. So it's not the greatest thing I've ever seen. There will be a moment that you're going to use this table. Be firm with it. OK. And then the last thing I tell you is that we reward people with that explorer. Oh, you have not to worry about that. I can promise you I will explore. Maybe too much will be the problem. So feel free to touch, drink. Oh, OK. I will. And then no one's going to say that? Yeah, that's perfect. And it sounds like it's going to be quite guided to an extent like wash. You'll see? Yeah. Fine. I don't need to wonder what to do. Yeah. I see the door window. OK. Swindle. Perfect. Enjoy. Can you reach the Garfield Cato Maddox answering service? That's the sound of the birth, please. I need your name. Phone number. Thank you, sir. Hi, sweetheart. I don't think you're with the population now. You know for all crowds, but remember, you do need to call those ones. And I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that. But remember, you do need to call those ones in a while. Cut like you're a bad teacher at Christmas. We do enough here. Oh, one more thing. Can you remember the Brinnell K-Ko? The one that made you last one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, my friend, for you, whatever. Just a drink on my beer. Take a home. And I'll be gone. Hello, Dad. I know I need to work with my high pitch. Just a few seconds. I'm really sorry about the mess. I meant to tidy up. But since we're heading out to eat anyway, what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Don't see a green bar, but... Oh, wow, that's unexpected. It's a bit of a surprise, but let's not worry about it too much right now. Let's go. That's definitely surprising. But hey, let's focus on having a great time out. We can tackle the rest later. Okay. That's quite a shocker, but let's keep the excitement going and enjoy our meal. Everything else can wait. Sounds good. Just thinking about all the delicious food we can have is making me hungry. Let's make some fun memories tonight. Absolutely. I can't wait to see what we end up choosing. Good company and good food always make for the best nights. You're down right. The man is good to see you. I told you about that new job. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. She's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. Whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, frontmariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. The jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says no. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur and the excess is just. It's all vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked, hold. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just the job. But, you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressery for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I hope I didn't leave it somewhere awkward. Well, it's here. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? No. Fine. We're fine. Don't look like vanilla rice. Bath on you. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Oh, yeah. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her flight. And she's just really cold. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, I'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incomprehensible say even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticising storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, and maybe that's stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's just Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, and she's just, she's just, she's just laughing. And so, I'm figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just gonna come at you. There I go. But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, if I'm inverbs via, like the opportunity to speak, and I just start talking. About... about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her only, from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. So, while it leads to go to bathroom, I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-locking day, someone's over the major day. And violence about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees and film at them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession that had on me. Cheese, I even promised that 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So, the major D. And so, somehow, I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean, hey, tell me how to do it. You know, tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them me to just step and do something different. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on. Don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'll just put it on the back. Now it's time for the lightest sound for a verse break. Gosh. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but Violet allowed to come pretty militant about sleep training and went to the game with him and he got crushed. Violet sent a love, she's on deadline so she won't be up to join us. And I know, I know, worse, her, and so other. We're just juggling a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of her and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of already. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's magical. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... Well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him and his older. You know, see what he was around him and his baby. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board there. Okay. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why the idea is painful. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orin, I remember seeing from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was Orin. He loves me being with my sister, living. That's it. Not pitching. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family hand. This was the former parents thought. And that place was like, well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people. Live other lives. We were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etching and just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way, Gizoo. Just to set. I'll go see you two, then maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple of days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. Not like he's been. She is listening to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a labs maker decision, but I've won every single fucking detail by you. Two days of kill to see the world the way you get. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... I'm going to have to keep this place up, I think. How can you go out and soak? No, I'll do it. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Fish! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Quite a loss, all of it, in fact. Okay, fine. If you're not going to say anything, I'll just tell myself. I totally won that argument. Not actually. You know, messy. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But Violet just went to see you like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin to York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but... I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas's came at once. And Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And... I had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat, I'm caught sighting it to the nap thing. Loved it. Just being fair. And we stayed up late. We had a couple of shows, but it was him dragging the arbeid in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you. I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm worried. Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Is that the end? The line memory? No, it's the... The white light connection that I allow into the image. Come on, man. Finish what you started. Maybe if I give him a slap. There's an internal counter that allows for the thinking and the talk about that. But if the connection is broken, we could get stopped there. I can put it back into that scene. Okay, gotcha. I find it quite hard to see the red and green by the way. I have to initially go like this to see it. Yeah, we've been playing around to understand how high it was to be. Yeah. And it's probably different from male and female as well. So we have different field of views. Can you put it to quick? Yeah. Okay. And then just press the U button for Unreal. Is that... Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now's this... Just doing this helps just because it creates a new connection. And you can isolate the scenes. Yeah. Cool. Are you in the lobby? Yep. I am. Should go black. Right now. Yeah. It's black at the moment, yeah. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he'd been. Do you listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without running every single fucking detail about you. Should the days we're killed to see the world where he gets? No, Violet. That's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I have people who are having so... No, I'll... Yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I heard you guys really much all of it. I heard everything. All right, fine. You heard me. But before you judge, remember, I'm better right in lyrics than having tough combat. Yes, it's interesting how we can hold on to so much. The memories, they really shape us, don't they? I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see aawry that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just wants to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I've heard you're young? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US because all his Christmas's came at once. There were small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And we had Korean food for the first time. We took him to sleep no more and to the mat. Of course I take it to the nap. I love that. Just being honest, I was also in third. We stayed up late for the shows, but it was him dragging me out bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. Don't worry. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? It's fascinating to think about what truly matters to each of us. I walk in the forest with my cat. It's beautiful how something as simple as that can leave such an imprint. Cats have this way of grounding us, reminding us to be present in the moment. Absolutely. They really do. Yes, yes. And those moments they linger like echoes in a vast hall. They remind me of my own walks with Aure just the two of us exploring the world together. I often find myself reflecting on how fleeting those times can be. It's crucial to embrace them, to hold them close like treasures in a chest. I agree with you. It's hardwarming to hear that we share this understanding. Moments like these, they weave the tapestry of our lives, don't they? Yes. I'll tell you about the climate that I'll eat in your. You did. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't... Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there with that. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't... Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Would you help me find them? Sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I found them now before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry, I've become so forgetful. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I'm good with me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. Yeah. But was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. Recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, did this? It is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I was in the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny. Because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. You'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're all demeanor. Shept it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversations side-wayed into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And how it was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. I know, remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy. Then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I've had completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't have anything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle him. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a sock. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? La B√©nie. La B√©nie. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, signorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Geno-key like it's plated. Gold and Prosecato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool. And you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trip on grace. You tried to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now. Oh, what a thrill. I'm just a return babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Well. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one mist, reply, and your wrong dish, do you know, all of by the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sim, you play a slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move, you mist, now look at you all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in, I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, turn the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the nights, I save you no take, then I can count, from broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and a stare, you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trast of array, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman jar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama me up in your flight, a Laura strones by a fan crew, I am not a man, I'm Gino, I can't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left to right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now, you can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step, only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. Do you think you can read my mind? He's had more locked up than a mob account in witness protection, I would better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo's, he's a Craig Fender now, he attests this big man all those ounces back in North of Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. Parlor tricks huh, your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know, I'm the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Madhawna ma gifigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist, rebound. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. So you read in yellow sunset, covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's red. That's it. That's as far as we got. Okay. Wow. They turned real.\n",

      " So this is correct. So, a few things. I'll be with you at the beginning of the experience. Just to check that you see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Okay. Once that's it, I know that the room hasn't moved. They're shook. It's good. It's happened to us where people appear on the other room. Yeah. And then, sorry, I'm sorry. You'll see a red line or a green line on top of it. When you see green, it means you're allowed to talk. When you see red, it means that you can't talk. Okay. Whereas we always say let him finish before you speak. Yes, I know. I had an experiment with AI, and I was like, don't talk until he's finished. So I'm going to use the table. Yeah. Make sure that you hit it quite heavy. Okay. The other thing is, at one moment you're going to move from this room to that room. Okay. Once you're in that room, you stay in that room. But if it's not clear when to move, then we're about to look at it and make it so you want to go. All right. And then, speak at this level of voice. That's what I like. It's so very loud. Not super loud, but just clear. Yes, exactly. Clear. And then last but not least, we reward people with that explorer. So if you're free to touch, eat, drink, whatever you want to do. Okay. Nice. So you should be in the lobby. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. See you for a seat, or? Yep. You know? Yep. Yeah. You reached the Garfield Cato Madoc answering service. At the sound of the bird, leave your name. Can't shoot size. Right, sweetheart, it's none. How's the job with the publishing house? You know, we're all proud, but remember, you do still need to call those ones for the while. Cut my gear all about it, you're a treatment. Meet you in the afternoon. Or one more thing. Can you remember you from that case? Just take it a shower. Thank you. Thanks. I'm going to wear the black ships in the night. My music's taken off for that, which is great, obviously. Sometimes. Sometimes you don't have long enough to tie me up those things to take care of all of it. Anyway. So everything's great. There it is. Ari. He's amazing. It's like, that's the day of my life, every night. It's my life. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, submit the case. I always wear those kinds of things from. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories of the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of your physical problems. But it keeps saying that from this part of existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be what I'd be like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know about whatever life. You know, help me know now or what you wish if you're a man. I think if you're really cool, somebody's older. Yep. See what I was around when I was a friend. So, a lot of times I would slip the paper. You can pin them on that boarder. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are. They're names from. It's so weird. You want to spend time with them already. I remember things from my childhood. And things I forgot. They really realized what temp rules they remember. They were worried. They weren't really being with my sister. That's she is. A picture. She had used to play this far. I had a family. This was a former parents' job. Not a place to play. So, sacred to us. I guess it's like a thousand. Whenever we went there, we needed to make it in the name of the heart. The come of the people. Live otherwise. Because we were kids, right? So, we were not living in our imaginations on that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, drive into castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. We had a path that we always taught to get in and out. She just... Stride, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found me again pretty quickly. But, we found my connectivity at the time. I was young. You have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to try to do something that... ...can't find anything. Just help easier is to do something that... ...against that's why I want to have something to worry. Something permanent. Edge and stone so it can't be lost, right? I'm whole the master of the way, isn't it? Just to set... I guess you can even think of me as a two-bump. Hi. I'm a little bit weird. That is her. That is her. To me, I'm afraid Mr. Two days is not big. I'm not in the shared hospital. But I hardly get to see him as this. No, no. He misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son. It's not much in the end of the book. What do you mean... ...don't give me tickets? It's not like he'd been. Listen to yourself for a second. No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a love to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Do you just need to take him killed to see the world the way he gets? Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. I'm going on to get this later, I think. I'll be fine, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Bitch! Oh. Um... Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, it's coming. How much did you hear about it? Nothing. I heard nothing. Yes, sometimes silence speaks louder than words. It can be uncertainly, uncertainly, but... Vice-matchery. I don't expect anyone to have all the answers. Things are just... You know... Messing. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either often. You know... I've been doing toilet all the time. Well... I'm approaching in a little unconvention that... Violet just wants to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time it's about you to be gone? The... Love. We only had a couple of shows and... I didn't think I'd thought the hell... I'd taken with me. Never been to the US, like all his Christmas and shame once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swabs for the big bands that like the concept of ex-clusivity. But I knew we'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the cities. And... And Keck Karin food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat. I'm caught sighting his in the nap today. Love them. Just three photos, does also have that. Speed up light. The show. But it was human drugging me out bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love you. I met my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to always hear what he needs to make. And I want to tell you that memory that it looks compolly, not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. That's all right. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I often wonder if memories are the threads that weave our lives together. I'd like to remember everything. It's beautiful to hear that. Memories they shape us like the colors in a painting. Each one unique and fighting. Yes, I agree. All right, fine. Remember. I'll tell you about the time I took out of you. Please. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. Of course it will. If you look, she's gone. Tric decision. Probably definitely smart. She was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're an idiot. You never let them see. Think. Think. No. Don't let them. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. Sorry, I had. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. It's just here. It's helped me try to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I leave them to read his notes. They're definitely in here. I'm certain I'll be out of here. I don't know where. Could you help me find them? There could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or all the drawers. Or so far. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. That is embarrassing. I have them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It was just difficult. I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I too about the time I lost my sister in the forums? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. Recallings of what they remember. I got this one from Byler the other day. It's the darkness thing. The hot it is. It is so embarrassing. Here it goes. It was a Italian restaurant. I was running 15 minutes late. When I was in the restaurant. I started to worry that you would have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossible. I didn't feel completely impossible. We didn't have cell phones back then. I couldn't just ring you to check. Finally, this young man mussels into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and outfit. If I'm honest, I'm just about ready to call it quite soon. I was really surprised when you finally rushed in. It was funny. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. Although I didn't know this yet. This is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. I didn't want to be late. That was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. I got caught in the rain, obviously. I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I was touched by it. I had this complete stranger. It would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. If I might be feeling united and immediately had a response. But you don't really start talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like picking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely in a fright to show me yourself. And then the conversation was segueated to a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck and Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first date, I was usually only involved in small talk. And I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually went into the jowl and take your hand. But I wasn't braving it myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a jowl. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely consequential stuff. And you just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't ever be doing that to you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for daily. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Barbara? Oh yeah, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. You're a lady friend. Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she goes back here, this, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Do you know? Got such hair. These guys said she's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and instead of looking. We have the policy that, no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. And this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. Do you think that's going to cover a tree-pulls meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait a minute. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is there how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a big, big copper throw, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That is copper, really. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what if you got to lose at this point? Vape in it. Vape in it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pavish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or priming off to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior, yes, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You strong and slick, but the scenes don't hold. Call him Geno Key, like it's played in gold. The post-cato pizza lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls are pulling. Cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trick on Grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. The The The The Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misstrip, fly in your own dish. Do you know how to fight a music swells? The moment spins. You'd love to heart nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're sin, you play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move, you misst. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the scene, she knows the face. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post. And watch you try your bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. The lights are slow and drinkin' in. I've been called many things. A major day, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of cancer poured. I've seen a war walk out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you no take. And I can count from broken lines to prosecone nights. I've turned disasters into flare with just a gradsy. And to stare, you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your meal. The same trace to beret. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the kingdom. And Jaram felt it. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mia in your plate. Allora strings. By a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning here for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object is hiding. No skipping. And you jump into the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I need. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? This has more locked up than a mob account in the witness protection. It would better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meeper. He's a great friend now. He attest his big man all the answers, suspecting knock on Nebraska. Real under the ladder. Slide. Slide. Power and tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Mad ol, nah. Good figure, dad. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snack been in time with the twist, people. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked when you performed the train. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as people walking out, you were slamming and it has to run. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out of you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone with you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets with her steamy, empty room. And this was the best game of my life. The mandolin flare. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. And the diners blink. That's it.\n",

      " Yeah, the second part is when we start, I'll be here with you just to make sure that we see the same thing so you should see a door, a window and a bookshelf. Okay. You'll see a red line or a green line sometimes in your headset. When it's green it means you're allowed to talk. When it's red means you're not allowed to talk. And when he's not listening to you that moment usually let him finish before anything else. Sometimes they say a little bit because we're in a basement so it's my AI ever heard. So it's a little bit longer but you know it happens. At one moment you'll be asked to move from this room to the next room. Yeah. Hopefully the story tells you when if not I'll be here to tell you when to move. And then last but not least when you reward people that are curious. Okay. You'll see. But basically you're allowed to. May I take my glasses off? Here you go. I should be here. Oh, yeah. There you go. Are you ready? Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean just actually make sure that it's got to be. Cool. All right. So here you go. Cool. All right. So feel free to play with whatever you see. Second. Okay. All right. So let's see. Yes. Yes. Round on 10 Round 1 Round 2 I waited up. What is your job? You're not a general proud but remember you do still need to call day one to the wild. Can't wait to hear all about it. You're in Christmas. We human up here. Oh, one more thing. Can you remember to bring that cake to show? I'd like to give a shout out. You're one of me in your arms, love. Thanks. You know the drill. Make yourself at home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beard. Take on me. Take on me. I'll be done. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. Mentor cleanup before heading out. So what are we thinking for food? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Chinese. Chinese food. Hold your voice. But I got a warning. The pace nearby is extra authentic. They don't hold back on spice. So hope you bore your fire extinguisher. Let's do it. Wow, really? I didn't expect that. Chinese sounds awesome. I can't wait for some good dumplings. Let's make the vegetarian. That's a great idea. Vegetarian options can be so tasty, especially with all those flavours in Asian cuisine. Agreed. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internetia. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. I'm not going to kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like uh, what's it called, little gumba? You know, frontmorricka? So there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to her office. And she's rounding about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed, and how she needs to trip her gut, she has the fourth and a different document Ronaldo. And then it dorns on me. But gumba sending me to the cavier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumbot, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too got-gump-scared of little gumbots to us with directions, so I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. For the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the exetative suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensuit to eyeball in me, and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set, but in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal, but I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbay yelling for me back in the office, so I'm freaking out, and I run down into the rat room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturmord's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket, so of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number down, and I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturmord, I am lost, I'm going to make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low ink. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside, and notes she goes full into blur in the excess distance, so I was harboring to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's firing paper out, it's our sendin' alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like RTX in the swan to sadness, and little Goon was there with them, she doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling at me, just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it? They fired me on this, thought I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, out of that, just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I think I might have left it on the couch. Yes, there. What do you think? It's a lot of fun. Is there any possible universe in which issue, where are they for the day? In assimilation. I just want to make sure I look good for tonight, first impressions are everything, right? 100%, you know, you'll be rocking. That probably mean that looked too good, and your dance that might style. Agreed. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? Yeah, absolutely. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this, something neutral. You hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name is Violet, and I met her on the gay tagline, and she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. She's just really smart. Did I tell you about what happened on the first day? It didn't last far, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing, I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted, so I missed the bus and ended up running to run there, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like I was going to just call out the urinal, and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really do anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a what's her name? Adrian in Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more, so I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. The less sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh god, it just died on me. Later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some g-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing, and so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. And you asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her roaming from the ground up. I'm just... spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell it was fine to pay, and I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late, so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole g-knocky gate, summons over the matri-day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matri-day takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the matri-day. And so somehow... I had too much to get out of it. So surely I got mess up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Get into your hands. Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it but... Why is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean... Fuck! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. I mean, just... Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? I'm gonna make a masterpiece. Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. I'll watch you. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Make yourselves at home. I'll just put your all into that. Keep going? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just a morning. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted it to make you all, but by the night I'm pretty militant about sleep training and going to the gym with them and you're crushed. By the time she's on the deadline, so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, we're sorry, Sarah. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. By the time she came out, she was under a lot of pressure. She and I were like, ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes we don't have long enough to type the young person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those comments up late this month, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of the physical parts. It keeps safe from this part of their existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool if it was older. You know? See what was around everyone on these pages. So, Robert Pan, a slip of paper, you can pin them on that board there. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are, they're a thing for us. It's sort of weird. When I spend time in Orey, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things like to go on. It made me realize what a temple is. I remember it. It really was all right. It must be a thing with my sister, Liz. There she is. I'm not picking. She knows to play this far. Behind her family home, this was the former town start. And that place was like, well, we saw sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we knew you were aching and then we'd be behind. Become other people. Live otherwise. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think I actually found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. It's an eternity stone, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake of this. Just to set it. I go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him. He's into a bumblebee. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Mr. Today. It's not big. Violet. It's a shame. Custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the world. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without winning every single fucking detail, Violet. Today's will kill to see the world the way he gets. Right, that's not bad. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. You don't have to make this place a pipe. I hope you provide it so. No, I'll. Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yadda's time. Speak now. Fiction. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about all of the things that you did? I don't know. I don't have to say anything. Vice-messy. I don't expect anyone to have all the answers. Things are just, you know, messy. I'm trying to be a good father to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either often. Especially with Torin all the time. Well. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took over to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. I never been to the US because all his Christmas came at once. There were small shows, small acoustics, what for the big bands, like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some downpipe. We spent all that time together. Me and him. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mats, I took it to the nap. And I loved it. The streamfans did also. I was like, I'm still up late for the show. But he was driving me out of bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to mean. I want in turn memory that he looks upon the fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think those memories they shape us, don't they? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not braven of that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look. What do they think? They know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the path you have to. I told you. I told you. I told you. I told you. I told you. I told you. I told you. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. Or in the cabinet. All the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. See that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in it. Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. Recording is what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, it is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I like the feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation side-wayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I know, remember thinking, my God, you're such a bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-cores meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a big cup of food, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. That is coffee for fear here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This is your name. Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's played at gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trick on grace. You tried to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm your last ditch hope. I'm your last ditch hope. I'm your last ditch hope. I'm your last ditch hope. I'm your last ditch hope. I'm your last ditch hope. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming. But near the end, one wrong move, one misrefly. And you're on dish, do you know? I'll abide the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sin. You play it slick, but here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move, you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see. The clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post. And watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of Cianci port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table, tune the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, no, tae, then I can count. From broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare, you brought your grin. Your little show, but Phil you'll me. You're the same trash to Ver√©e. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman. Jaram Velvitt. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia in your plate. Allora strums. By a fancou. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. Or we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a Craig Fender now. He tests this big man, old and honest. There. Nebraska. Rio under the radar. This actually, it's hurting my head quite a lot here. It's like a lot of pressure. Slide. You know, the salt anymore. That parts over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhawna ma gifigada. Oh, he's so good. Oh, he's so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. I'm so good. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow suns had covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The candle and flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diner. There you go. That's probably half. Okay. I take this off. Yeah. Yeah.\n",

      " instruction everything we're doing and we're starting from the inside. So a couple of things, one we'll begin, one of the insides room with you. You should see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. That's correct and tells me that we're in the right side of the room. It has that in the room, so that's one. At some point you will go from this room to that room. When you go to that room, you stay in that room. If it's not clear when to go, from where I'll make sure that you're at. Hopefully the story tells you, but you know, sometimes it's a little bit tricky. You will see a green or red line on top of your head. When it's green, it means you're at the top. When it's red, you know I like the top. We always say let him finish a phrase before you start a phrase. Okay? Yes. Speak at this level. So none need to shout or also know you. Okay, because otherwise you want to hear one listen to you. When you use the table, which you will use, make sure that you give it a nice little tap. And then finally is we reward exploration and playing around with things. So feel free to touch, do whatever you want to do. Can I take, take, take, you can take things. You good? Yes. Oh, you're just in my French. It's good. I just take the out. Yeah, sure is good. I can hold it. Yeah. All right. There we go. You should be the lobby. Lobby men. Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The Garfield Cato Maddox. Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Sounded the book. Leave your name. It's like one number and two sides. I just say no. It's nothing. I have to go with the cup of thin half. You know, I've always tried to prevent that. You can't feel me cold. I want to know why. I can't wait to hear all the bad. I can hear it. I'm just going to make sure that you're nothing. Oh, one more thing. Can you remember? Just take it a shower. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take a home. Take a beer. Take a home. Take a home. Take a home. Take a home. Take a home. Take a home. Take a home. Oh, baby girl. Hello, Daddy. I can't see. Sorry about the mess. I meant to tidy up, but with us eating out, it slipped my mind. What do you feel like for dinner? French, Italian, Chinese, or should I just slumber? I'd like to have some maybe Italian. All right, but seriously, they're going to put pitch rumours on the client of the decade. And it's only a six. There are you? Wow, really? Italian sounds amazing. I'm always up for some good pasta. And a nice app. That's interesting. I didn't expect that, but it makes sense. Pasta is so comforting, and the vibe at those places is usually great. And what are you going to, Adur? I'm thinking of going for a classic spaghetti carbonara. It's one of my things, and I love how creamy and rich it is. Plus, it pairs perfectly with a nice glass of red wine. Okay, so we made our decision. I'd like to take the new key. That sounds like a solid choice. New York style pizza is always a winner. And it's so fun to share a slice with friends. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just as sight me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of, sure, you know, kind of a boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, for a while you're gone. So there I am this morning. A little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me that gumba is sending me to the... ...copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be a little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gotgump scared of little gumba to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. And then I'm going to get a new one. And then I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types in suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, I'm in it from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear a little gunbie yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Strummer's singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents, and I'm lining the number dials, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Strummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen in the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy, but I know we're an over and over, and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noises out. And notes she goes full into Blair, and the exorcist. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere, on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are worsein' from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like our texts in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it? They fired me on this talk. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to knock mess up and make an impressing for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I hope I didn't leave it in theÁà™t. Uh... Yes? Is it this one? Where are you? Uh... Yes? Is it this one? Where are you? Um... Oh, my. What is that? Is it scared me? Is it scared me? Is that any possible universe in which issue? Where are they for the day? Oh my god, what are you doing here? I can't believe it either. It feels like time just flew by. And now I'm here trying to figure everything out. Alright, silence speaks louder than words. That's the square one. Shall I just rob a paper band? You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was... A total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... I'm not sure. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Huh? Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a power chiles that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up wanting to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I look like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... What's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? I can't even say even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticising storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...jean-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her what was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate, so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate, someone's over the matreday. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matreday takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the matreday. And so somehow I had too much to get out of it. So surely I can't miss out twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you need to stop and do something different. Maybe just... Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. What are you doing over there? Come here. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. I'm going to do a little bit of your work. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. She's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. My music is taking off for a bit. Sometimes you don't have enough to take the other person in to take care of already. Everything is great. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's a bit of a favour. I was thinking about how people don't read memories for the first few years of their lives. I was thinking about how people can get to create something physical for them. It keeps it from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it'd be cool for him when he's older. So, rubber pants, slip of paper, you can pin them on that board. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where the air came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Orey. I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It mainly realised what a temporel thing memory is. He was Orey. He wants me to be with my sister, but there she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parent's job. That place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people. We'd live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. I'm trying to find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't he? I go see each other and maybe commit him to his and two grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. What? Daddy's here. Daddy's here. I'm here. Did it break? Yeah, I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. It was. It was. Yeah, I think so. You hear anything? No. Just give this way. Can you press the quick? Quick. Quick. And now press the Unreal button on the test file. Oh, I really am. Oh, yeah. Slow. Is it responding? Yeah, it says it is responding. Yeah, so quick. Start again. Are you in the lobby? Are you in the lobby? No, yes. Now you should go back. Oh, to me it breaks. It's not a big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple of days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the wood. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a lab to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Should the station be killed to see the world the way he gets? Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so. No, I'll. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's time. Speak. Fitch. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? About what? About you? About what sound like a math. What are you doing here? Things are just... It's interesting how something so simple can hold so much meaning, isn't it? Like, you know, the memories we create around it. They seem to stick with us. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.E. that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time it's an old New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute. It figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. All his Christmas's came at once. There were some small shows, small, acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. We had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, to our court side tickets at the nap, to the end. Loved it. The streamfermist does awesome, though. And he stayed up late, the shows. But he was human drugging the arbeid in the morning, and he went out and then do more, and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I mean, there are those moments, you know, that just... They linger, don't they? Yes. What's the thing you never want to forget? It's like capturing a snapshot, right? Those fleeting instances, they become part of our story, shaping who we are. There are so many, but I think the day I first held Ori in my arm. I never thought this was my life at that moment, you know? It felt like the world shifted, you know. You're famous just a memory I want to hold on to forever. I'll tell you about the time I took I ate in New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not braving off of that. It'll be there, will it? Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot, you never let them see. They... Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think... Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ori, he was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no, that's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets, and I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or on the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I just... Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. What did you forget? I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything, things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? That was scary. But you were a kid. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there, and I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a buzz and decided that I should probably just run here, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but... You'd already started talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation side-wayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So now, remember thinking, oh my god, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself, and then I think... I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and... Yeah, other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just... Listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert... I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear... What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first day, then I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom, so if she comes back here, this... I should think of my fool. Please. I'm a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or bright enough to be dangerous. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me, seniorius and you're. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and slick, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated. Gold and proskado pizza. I'm a man with a lot of plans with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. If you've 10 or 10 Under the neon sky.\" Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move, now look at you all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fate, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in, I've been called many things, a major day, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, tuned the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save you no tape, and I can count from broken lines to prosekone nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and a stare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trace to ver√©e, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the candelman jar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama mea, in your plight. Allora strones, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid down in line, left to right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. If you slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now, you can move left or right, whichever is closer, once that, only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo's. He's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide, slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know that there's anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Madhornam. Oh, gaffigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist rebo. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, you why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. Okay.\n",

Okay, so if you want to come through there. Okay. That's it. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Come with me. You can leave your, your phone. Oh, yes. Turn around. Turn around. Yeah. Wow. So in a perfect scenario, you would have actually been outside. Okay. Then we would put the headset and everything and then you would open it and you would open it and do the space. I can go out. Yeah, but because of the, the, the, the infrastructure and everything we're doing, we're starting from the inside. So a couple of things. When we begin, I'm going to be inside the room with you. You should see a door, a window and a bookshelf. Okay. Okay. That's correct. And it tells me that where the rights are of the room. Okay. It has that and that the room is have to be flipped. So that's why. So at some point, you will go from this room to that room. When you go to that room, you stay in that room. Okay. Okay. If it's not clear when to go, then where about it? I'll make sure that you're not. Oh, yeah. Hopefully the story tells you, but you know, sometimes it's a little bit tricky. And you will see a green or a red line on top of your head. Oh, yeah. When it's green, it means you're allowed to talk. When it's red, you can add that to talk. Okay. Sure. And we always say let him finish the phrase before you start a phrase. Okay. Yes. Okay. So let's just speak at this level. So no need to shout, but also no need to be like this. Okay. So otherwise, we won't be wanting this into you. When you use the table, which you will use, I'll make sure that you give it a nice, nice little tap. And then finally is, we reward exploration and playing around with things. So feel free to touch, do whatever you want to do. Take things. You can take things. Yeah. Okay. That's fun. Yeah. Let's see. You good? Yes. Oh, did it tighten? Oh, it's just my French. I did French. Yeah. I can. Ah, it's good. It's good. I just take them out. Good. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. Hmm. Good. Yeah. Here is good. I can't hold it. Yeah. All right. There we go. Hmm. Okay. You should be in the lobby. Mm. Lobby men. Yeah. Okay. So behind you, you should see the door. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. A window. Yeah. You hear it here? Yes. And then a bookshelf. Bookshops, yes. Enjoy. Yeah. Hmm. I say that in the show. That show is coming. You know. You know, I don't know if you're going to have that. I don't know. I like to know that. I think you're going to have all the way. Yeah. Okay. Oh, you can play. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I just haven't found a coffee for you. Whatever. Just a drink of my beer. I'd like to have some maybe talent. Well, it's great. But seriously, we've got to put pitchwit levels on the claims of death, and it's only really sick. There are you? Wow, really? Italian sounds amazing. I'm always looking for some good plastic, and they're nice, that's interesting. I didn't expect that, but it makes sense. The plastic is so comforting, and the vibe of those places is usually great. What are you going to, Oder? I'm thinking of going for a classic spaghetti carbonara. It's one of my things, and I love how creamy and rich it is. Plus, it pairs perfectly with a nice glass of red wine. Okay, so we made our decision. I'd like to take the new key. That sounds like a solid choice. New York style pizza is always a winner, and it's so fun to share a slice with friends. Man is good to see you, and it's such a terrible day I've got fired. I told you about that new job, sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or maybe it's just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure. I'm kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumbered. You know? Fru-fuck-fru. So there I am this morning, a little gumber someone's need to rough us and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed and how she needs to trip her cupies at a 40 different document she's holding and then it dawns up and the gumber is sending me to the copy room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine man, I swear Sarah might be a little gumber but just finding these things like an Arthurian quest, it's like on the other side of the building in the places of total range but I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression and I'm too got scared of little gumber to us with directions so I just start running from room to room, telling that I know where I'm going but for the longest time, whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three flights of stairs and across and then up again and suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor, it's the excessive sweep and these two slip charlie sheen types into two to eyeball and I know I'm not supposed to ever reset or in the ivory fucking tower so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything to all but I know the copy of room is in the basement so I get out of there, I start dushing by down and screaming at myself, find the path, find the path like I'm Indiana Jones by this point you know the star of film when he's trying to escape with an idle and shit is coming from all sides and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I could get a little gumber yelling from the back of the office so I'm freaking out and I run down into the back room in the basement and the dubox is playing Joe Stunder singing, Amor Alaskan in the soup and market, so of course I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed but then somehow I actually find a way to get out of there and I'm loading up with a document and I need a number down and I'm thinking it's really huge, I'm going to make it and I'm going to press probably and then the alarm goes off. The screen in the foot part says no. So I fill it with ink, I'm so desperate I just can't hammer in the copy part of it over and over and over and over, it's like I killed it and make this pittiest grinding of the glare in the access system so I'm robbing ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors and the fucky ceiling and it's firing paper out his ass and then a large sandwich and a staffer was shooting for the officers to see what's happening and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, cobbling it in looking like our types and the swamp of sadness and little gumber's there but she doesn't say anything. She just stems there smiling, she's smiling like she's thinking, see I knew and I asked hold, that was it, they fired me on this top I mean it's just a job but you know I really wanted out of there. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for one. Can you see my jacket now? Yes? Is it this one? Where are you? Where are you? Oh. Oh my, you scared me? Is that any possible universe in which issue brought this to the day? Oh my god, what are you doing here? I can't believe it either, it feels like time just flew by and now I'm here trying to figure out what I'm doing. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing. I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing. I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing. She's staring to be an actor and funny and beautiful like across between what she wants and Jennifer Connolly and she's just a really smart. I'm going to tell you about what happened on Thursday. God, I was so late. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of jobs and we're a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there and it started raining on the way, like, stumbling down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant I looked like I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal and she just sitting there quiet and sort of still. I'm having an obvious thing. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's her name. Adrian in Rocky is nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have unconcerned say even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, I've heard to get in word in age raised and then. Oh Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I've been talking on stop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried to lie in the mood by telling a joke and just, god, they just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's just Italian place. I say something dumb asking for something. She's got some g knocky or something equally ignorant and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just, yeah. Just hot-slacking. And so I figuring that's it. I'm scared. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cold and you just can't help it. Fuck it up with the very first yom chan. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... Oh my god. This is a spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just has to be in a flash until it's time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ride late so, finally it's to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocking game that's someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto an easy front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just put the love of God company little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet was back in. And I'm still my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering to the major D. And so... Somehow... I had too much to get out of it. So... Surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She really special. I've got this... This... This... This for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that... I think stress is what she actually needs to be. I just... I can't... Get it on my path. What you do when... When you're mentally blocked. Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this memory of God. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says. I mean... It's funny how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. They probably actually mean to you. I'm a just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling you to... To step and do something different. Just... Ah! Let me try again. What do you say? Maybe this? Come on. Come try again. Come on, don't be scared. Hmm? Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Huh? Come here. Come here. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. The other room? Yeah. There is a shelf. Why is so narrow? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Oh, she's... Oh, she's... Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Oh, my God. Hey. I'm really worried it's me. Look, five and nine, but you know this is about to happen. Pretty good, isn't it? You're crushed. Five and nine, but pretty good. Pretty good. Five and nine, but pretty good. Five and nine, but pretty good. Pretty good. Five and nine, but pretty good. And I will... One shit's in the night. My music's taken off from it, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't, I'm long enough to type the other thing in, to take care of Ari. Anyway, well... Everything's great. It's Ari. She's amazing. It's like, best day of my life, every day. It's my... Look, I had this idea I wanted you to... well, to be prepared. I always go through this kind of way to this moment, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories for the first few years of their lives. It keeps saying, for this part of existence, I was wondering if you find writing a message. It can be what every life, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better to spell, to know about whatever life. You know, what you know now, or what you're wishing on that. I think it'd be really cool for my job. So, a lot of times, I just sit in the paper, and think about not knowing that. I said you could hear this. I think it's in a moment. I don't really know what you are, you know, a game problem. It's so weird. When I spend time in all, it feels like a dog. It may be realised, what's in full, in memory of me. In the long run, it might be really my sister, but there she is. No picture. She knows playing this horror, behind a family house. This was the full-time star. My place was like, well, I saw it, safe into it, in this weird kind of way. I guess, it's like, when we went there, we'd leave the place and then really behind, and come up with people, live otherwise. Because we were kids, right? We were living in our imaginations of that. We did that whole kingdom, drive into castles. And because it just got so much just gigantic pay-around. So we never really considered the idea of it being dangerous. One day they got lost in there. We had a perfect, we always put to get in an hour, and she just, straight, I guess. There's the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found me again pretty quickly, but it's not like I'm a dirty, and it's hard. I was joking. You have no real sense of consequence of that. What it means to actually do something, but that's it. I'm not afraid of being it. Just how easy it is to lose something with that. I guess that's why I want to have something to worry. Something curing. Etching stones that cut it off, right? Oh, the matter of the lake is it? Just that. Just see if you can hear the community. I don't know if you can hear me. What? I'm here. Wow, you're here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Did it break? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Like, here. Right? Do you hear anything? No. Can I just hear? It's okay. Just look at this one. Look at this one. Yeah. Okay. Can you press the quit? Can you press quit? Quit. Yes. Quit. Yeah. Yeah, and now press the Unreal button. On the test file. Oh, Unreal. Oh, yes. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Just slow. What's that? Mm-hmm. Is it responding? Closed. Yeah, it says it is responding. Yeah, so quit. Quit again. Okay. Start again? Yeah. All right. Just a minute. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are you in the lobby? Mm-hmm. Are you in the lobby? No, yes. Mm-hmm. Now you should go back. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm new, new, new, new city. It's not big. Violet. It's shared, custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually easy. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. He's over here. Don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a loud spanked decision without running every single fucking pizza by you. He's playing a kill to see the world where he gets. Violet, I've lost all of that. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. If you don't, he's like a hype. I hope you do, Violet, so... No, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. There you go. Yeah, that's the time. Speak. Bitch! Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't see you guys coming. How much did you hear about? About what? About your... Who was sounding like a math? What are you doing here? I think it's interesting how something so simple can hold us so much meaning, isn't it? I think you know the memories we create around it. They seem to stick with us. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all that often. You know, especially with toy and all the time. Both. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but Violet just went to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I could always be young? The... Loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. I'll take them with me. You never think of the US as I bore all these christmas' came at once. There were small shows, small acoustics spots for the big band that I could concentrate on. Exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downpike. We should spend all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And... Tecri, through the first time. I took him to sleep the more and to the map to our courts like tickets and the napkin. Loved it. That's been though, it's been a bit of a disaster. And stayed up late for the shows, but it was human drug in the out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love you, I meant to my father. And we did have much of relationship after he left. But I want to owe you to know what he needs to mean. I want to tell you, memory, it looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I mean, there are those moments, you know, they're just... They linger, don't they? Hmm, yes. What's the thing you would never want to forget? It's like capturing a snapshot, right? Those fleeting instances, they become part of our story, shaping who we are. There are so many, but I think the day I first held Aurea... I never thought this was what I wanted to think. At that moment, it felt like the world shifted. Just making it a memory I want to hold on to forever. I'll tell you about the time I took away from you. Please. No, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember it. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not braving off of that. It'll be there, with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do. They... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do. They... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all will look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ory. He was just here. He was helping me find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I didn't think they were in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry, I have to come so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. What did you forget? I've been writing my memoirs. That was just difficult because I'm losing everything and things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Not what's scary. But you were a kid. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from five of the other times. It's the darkness thing. I did that. Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was in the Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man was supposed to be the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, that was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of mean of how I like being late. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. You hold a meter, shut it. It was like picking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it that felt almost intimate. Like you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation is slightly into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck in her. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. From my effort states I wish I only got a small talk. Because I never remember thinking, oh my god, you're such a bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and... Yeah, I had a completely inconsequential step and you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little funny, but by dessert I already knew I went in everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your late friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of my fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Do you know? What's that? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. And with this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Where to say it? So you think you're a big copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That is copper, here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So where did you go up to lose at this point? Well, I've been. Well, I've been. If you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Why not to be dangerous? I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This is strong. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Call him Geno Key. Like it's plated. You slip me a bracelet, collateral sheet, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. I'm not going to be a genius. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misprocline. You're on dish duty, no alibi, the music swells. The moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your vet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sin. You play a slick, but here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move, you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes. She saw the scene, she knows the fate. So pitch your charm, reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin. Well, I said slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a morgue out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save punetay that I can count. From broken lines to prosek on nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And this dare, he brought your grin. Your little show, but feel your me, you're the same trash to array. You played your part, I won't deny. But you can't trick the kindelman jar. You're the same velvet in a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mia in your plight. Allora strings. By a fancou, I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He says more locked up than a mob accounts in witness protection. I would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a great bandit now. He tests this big man, all those answers, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Power tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which is? This is your object. Madornama. Get figged up. He's the spark in a velvet storm. Snack in time with the twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you put forth the tray. It was the same way you looked when you played. Breathe. Everything. Find yourself. And as we were walking out, you were slamming me and asked me why. They just shook your head and told me that you could not. I was using the bathroom to squeeze to run on you. Because you never believed that someone liked me. Or didn't so spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. We walked into the red and yellow suns that covered the streets. Which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The candle is clear. The base drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. Have a diner. That's it. That's super cool. I'm missing one scene. I miss the one scene. We're missing one scene. It's super cool. It's a matter of human. The guy. Super real. How long did you divide up this? It's huge. It's a huge project. Amazing. Amazing. I was figuring out what things were new. It was real. That's cool. Should I take that? I don't want to break it. Cheers. Here we go. Cheers.\n",

      " see the green nine minutes you can speak if you see the red nine minutes you can't speak. Okay. At some point you'll move from this room to that room. But if it's not clear, don't worry about it. I'll be watching and I can tell you when to move. And then last but not least is we'll be more exploration. So feel free to grab things, touch things, play with things, eat things, drink things. Yeah, thank you for telling me drinks. All right. Green? Oh no, it's a little friendly. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You should be in the lobby. Yeah. Come in. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I actually don't know if it's enough. I have to jump at the top of the chin down. You know, overall proud, but remember, you do need to call those ones for the wire. You can't wait to hear all the bellings during Christmas. We should love you all the fun, all the fun, all the things. Can you remember just that you were one of the nature-all ones? Thank you. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, round the call field, whatever. Just a little bit. Hey. Haha. Take me, go on me. Take me, I'll be by your side. Hello, Red. I'm not even in the morning. I'm just here. Just two seconds. Sorry, what happened? Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway, right? So what do you want to eat? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Burgers, please. You didn't hear what I said? Yes, let's go for the beaten path. Who knows? Right, just find that new favourite spot. Oh, man, I'm so spaced out today. I was going to tell you something, but it slipped my mind. We'll talk about it later. I think I did. Wasn't it something about burgers and peace? Sorry about the mess. Come on, don't be like that. It's not every day we get to hang out. What's up? What would we do? I said, burgers sound good to me too. I'm starved. Okay, let's go. No, seriously. Let's go. Hold on. Let me grab my walkman. I've got the new Bon Jovi tape and we can listen to it on the way. Yeah, that's nice. You're going to love it slippery when wet is their best album yet. Okay. Come on, let's roll. The others are probably waiting for us. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, a little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum-scared of little gumber to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to wear room set, but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, when to start the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gum be yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the rap room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up for the documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says no. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And note she goes full into Blair in the access system. So I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with her. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew and I asked hold, that was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impressing for once. Hey. I think I left it on the couch. Oh yeah, I can see that. Um... What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Uh, sorry, what do you mean by that? No big deal if you can't find it. I'll just grab something else. Never mind. I was just wondering if I could just go to the bathroom and get a drink. I'm not sure if I could just go to the bathroom. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, the thing's for grabbing it. I feel like I'm gonna need a lighter tonight. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the gate egg flight. And she's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just... really smart. So I tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up riding to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I look like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... I'm just wondering what's happening today in Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how... Chris Isaac stole my name and my plans for it and somehow, they'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in Adrian then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some g-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but... Fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. And then it goes viral at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so violently used to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole g-knocky gate, someone's over the maturday. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major D. And so somehow... I had to get out of it. So surely I can't miss out twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... This thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... Get it on the path. What you do when... When you're mentally blocked. Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... To stop and do something different. Alright. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the part. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on your dad. Okay. I'm just putting on your dad. What are you doing over there? Well, that's the part. It's the place where you go. You know? I'm just putting on your dad. You know? I'm just putting on your dad. You know? I'm just putting on your dad. I'm the common don'tsess, I'm the only one. Hey, sorry about that. Hi, I really wanted to meet you all, but try to allow her to come pretty militant about sleep training and try to begin with and then you're crushed. Try to send her up, she's on the line so she won't be up for joy or send you. I know, I know, worse, her, and so on, we're just joking about stuff and then while it came harder and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to type the up person in to tell him already. Anyway, everything's great because it is, Auri, he's amazing, he's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea, I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always birthed those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical about it. It keeps it from this part of the existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever, like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when it's older, you know? It's so easy to see what's around it when we face. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that more than that. I think it's between us. I think it's gonna love us. I don't really know what they are and they're thankful. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at Auri, I remember seeing some of my childhood. You know, things are so long. It may be very nice what a ten-poor thing that we need. If you agree, it must be being with my sister, maybe. There she is. You're not picked. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our pyreons. This was the former parents part. I'm not a place for life. Well, we saw sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the Aiken and Lily behind. Become other people, live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We were all kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. She just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually do something that they... ...corrified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. It's interesting, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the lake is he? Just a sat. I'll go see him, maybe for me, and he's into a bomb. Hi, hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you, Bray? You missed you, Dave. Small thing. My little bit of shit. Pustody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. See, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, don't understand, by the way. I'm actually a love maker decision, but I'm funny every single fucking detail about you. Just a minute. Wait, I don't know if it's not bad. No. I'm not sure if you look by, but I don't miss a thing. I don't know if it's bad, but I'm just going to like it. I have people like, so, no, I'll, yeah. I'll call you back. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Fish. Sorry. I didn't, I didn't need you guys to come in. How much did you hear about everything, but I didn't understand it. Well, there goes my sharp, and I'm a chill put together guy. I know, I know. What do you mean you didn't understand it? Things are just, you know, messy. I'm trying to be a good father, so make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconvincially, but by let's just see it like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I was an originian? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US, because all his Christmas's came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands, like the concept of extracurricular activity. But I knew he'd have some down time, and we spent all that time together. Me and him. He explored the city, and kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the max of course I take it to the nap today. I loved it. History first, as I was in third. And we stayed up late for the shows, but he was human drugging the arbeid in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I don't know when you were I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship at the last, but I want to know what he needs to mean. I want in turn memory that it looks conformally, not just the rock star father that was never there. I have the time I think that's all that they are. Memory. You said everything, but that's a lot to hold on to. Is there one thing, just one thing, that you'll never want to forget? Me. I don't like playing piano, I guess, for some play piano. Take your time, it's okay. Why is that? Didn't think you had a problem with music? Pre piano, like before I started. Not really. I think I know. Okay, let's put the piano talk aside for now. How was your day? Not too bad. No. All right, let's stick with the conversation. What conversation? Indeed, it's been a bit of a winding road, hasn't it? I'll tell you about the time I took away from you. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They... Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try to find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Let me find them. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I've found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, I'm so sorry. I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister and the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. I was talking to this thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. When it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man puzzles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, you're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braving of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't have anything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I, yeah, I'm God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I'm not here tomorrow, I'm not paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. Please, just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that's... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a big, big copper floor, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That's a copper tree here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Well, I'm paying it. Well, I'm paying it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or prying off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty. No ale by the music swells, the moment spins. You're trying to lead, but you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty. No ale by the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet, and hold that grin. The plates are stacked, and soaps your sin, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move, you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I'm not denied, but you can't trick the Kendelman jar, I'm velvet. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama Mia in your plate. I'm not a man, I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left to right, but we start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step, only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a great friend now. He attests big men, old and undressed, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. My the orna ma gifigada. Oh, he's the sparking of velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, we were smiling when I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. But I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's it. That's what we have. Okay. I got it. I got it.\n",

I want a new dog, want a life to eat cheese. Want this very well groomed, doesn't have too many kicks. I want a new dog. I'm mentally enough, since we're eating out anyway. And they kind of fall apart after that. But it's a good beginning. Chinese. Or should we just say, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big, I'm not a big big, I'm not a big, I'm not a little bit. ______ Why is it all that bad? Something, someone is really like you. If you start complaining, you have to sign your merits. Just once, don't eat. Eat from your%, we eat. Hello? Whoa, that's a bummer. I can't believe I let it get this messy. Let's definitely do something fun for dinner, though. How about some delicious tacos? Sure. Are you going to make them? I'm going to make them. Wow, that's a relief. I was... That's a surprise. I didn't think it would be so easy to decide. I'm excited for some tasty tacos now. Making them? Oh, no way. I wouldn't want to risk turning this into a kitchen disaster. It's way better to leave it to the pros at the taco joint. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types and suits are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set, but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm aligning the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm going to make it. Then I press copy. And then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full of the blur in the excess. So I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. It's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine. Coventing looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew. And her household. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression of you once. Can we check if your jacket is out there? I just want to make sure we don't leave anything behind. And what do you think? What do you think of us? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Oh yeah, it's lovely. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. Oh yeah, it's lovely. We should wear it. I really hope it's still there. It would be such a bummer to lose it, especially if it looks that good. Alright. Signing speaks louder than words. In fact, it's the square one. Shall I just wrap a paper band? You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her applied. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like... ...across between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus, and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... ...what's her name? Adrian? In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more, so I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how... ...crisisic storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke, and just... ...oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... ...g-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...hots laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, undone, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but... ...fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking... ...about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spelling around. Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and... ...till it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so, while it leads to go to bathroom, I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole... ...dunocky guy, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like... ...I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. ...to the major D. And so, somehow... ...I had to even host to get out of it. So, surely I got myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and... ...I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. What you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked. Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job, like my dad says. Ha! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. I actually mean to you. I'm just... ...maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you tell them... ...to stop and do something different. Ha! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on your ear to bed. I'm just putting on your ear to bed. I'm just putting on your ear to bed. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But by the night I'm pretty militant about sleep training. I'm going to the gym with him and you're crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse host Ella. We're just struggling a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of her and she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were... ...like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes... ...sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Orie. Anyway, look. Everything's great. Really, it is. Orie... ...he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...well... ...it's a bit of a fader. I always birthed those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Orie. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are doing a cane drop. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Orie. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He was only one living with my sister, but there she is. Not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents died. And that place was like, well, you're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're actually living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, and she felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, cosy. Just a sec. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet him. He's in too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. I'm here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. I think this might be a bit broken. Did you break? I think so. Is it like that? I think it's like a big. You're gonna look at it. You're like pretty much sure that I'm pretty sure I know what it is. It's kind of like the graphic is jammed. Yeah. Yeah. Give him a second. OK. I'm gonna put a pack on. Yeah. And then tell me, can you give him any? Yeah, five isn't responding. Close up. Yeah. Maybe it wants to hand things, is it? Yeah. Close up. We go. Got the billboard. Yep. Have you, um, if you can just press the one that says you? You? Uh-huh. Now on the bottom here. On the, instead of you, for Unreal. It doesn't have it there. Let me see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, there it is. Hey, what does this? Yeah, it's tricky. It's a really funny one because it's like, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it will break because of the RAM. That's all that is. Because of which? Of the RAM. The RAM. The RAM. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just warning me. Now, you're the first person to have this problem. Yeah. That's okay. I know you have to leave very shortly, so. There you go. Thanks. You're in the lobby. Yeah. Mm-hmm. There's a lobby. Should be going to the scene. Oh, give me a break. Oh, yes. It's two days. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so, management is going to stay anat today. Okay, okay. So you want to have some security for me, too. I work for a few minute. It's not a big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as he is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean, don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. You can listen to yourself for a second. Yeah. No, you don't understand by that. I'm actually a mile to make a decision. But I don't know how we see what the fuck in detail by you. Juditator killed to see the world the way he gets. By that. That's not fair. No. No. Look by that. By that, listen to me. Look. I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's the time. Speak. Fifth. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? A good bit. Okay. So, you know, Violet and I... Things are just, you know, messy. I'm trying to... to be a good father, to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see the way you're doing it. I'm trying to... I don't see R.A. that often. You know, especially with Torian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but... Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin of York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... There was no last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas' came at once. There were some small, small, acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. We had to get up some downtime. And we spent all that time together. Me and him... explore the city. And get Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat, of course, I take it to the nap, too. I loved it. Extreme fairness does also affect. And he stayed up late for the shows, but... It was him dragging the out bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more, and see more. I love a new one. I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to know what he needs to make. I want him to have memories that he looks upon the family. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After time, I think that's all that they are. What's the one thing you think you'd never want to forget? I often find myself wondering about those moments that truly define us. I don't know. There's something about fleeting memories, you know. They slip away if we don't hold on to them, but they shape who we are, don't they? I guess so. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Please. It's interest. Please. I can't, please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there, with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. I have no idea what those two will think to be. If you! I have no idea. It will... You'll attain. What does money mean? Is it money? I'm keeping my money. Oh, well, I bet three more days of Yard oath I had to pay five. I failed to hold those. them please don't I told you stay in the path you have to oh it's you sorry I didn't hear you come in now let me have a look at you my guards you look so well you all look the same age seems to be only me that's getting older you just missed Ari he was just here um it was helping me trying to find uh he was just here he must have had to leave oh no that's it he's talking me to try and find my glasses I need them to read it lunch so they're definitely in here uncertain of it I just I don't know where could you uh would you help me find them they could be in the bookshelf or or in the cabinet I've found them there before or all the drawers or on the sofa or or maybe under the table um how about the chair I didn't think they're in there but or the piano or all the plants or oh oh I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful I just oh oh dear that is embarrassing I've had them the whole time in my pocket good goodness me I've been writing my memoirs that was just difficult because I'm I'm losing everything things who always did though did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in oh that was scary oh I I'm aware I'm not what I used to be I've been getting people to send me voice notes recordings of what they remember oh I got this one from Bylett the other day it's it's the darnest thing all right oh yeah god this is embarrassing okay but here it goes um it was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant I was actually running 15 minutes late but then I rushed I yeah I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there and then I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up I mean when I met you at your gig you just seemed like this impossible be cool young guy so yeah the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible and we didn't have cell phones back then so I couldn't just ring you to check and then finally this young man ustles into the restaurant but it wasn't you remember I had only seen you with makeup so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that the big hair and the outfit and if I'm cleanist hmm it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in yeah and it was funny because you weren't cool at all you were you were so freaked out by the fact that you were late and although I didn't know this yet and this is because of who you are Chris um I just always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions oh my god I'm so sorry I missed the buzz and decided that um I should probably just run here yeah because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain obviously but uh well I mean I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris uh god I was touched by it how this complete stranger would seem I don't know so together and beautiful when he was performing and but now dripping with water and uh sweat was he was only aware of me of how I might be feeling and I I know I I didn't know he'd nearly had a response but yeah you you don't ready to start talking about um your music and it was sort of incredible like you hold a meter shifted um it was it was like peeking behind the curtain of someone we just met but there was such openness about it it felt almost intimate yeah it felt almost intimate like you were completely unafraid to show me yourself and then the conversation segwayed into a story I got your sister Lily and how it destroyed your family after she passed away and yeah how it destroyed you and um I was just dumb struck Chris because it's just it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable it's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply and I don't know all my other first days have usually only involved in small dog um yeah I remember thinking my god they're such bravery to the sky and I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand but I wasn't brave enough myself and then I think uh I think at that point you might have actually made a dog that I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really I don't know I wasn't really paying attention so I didn't know whether to laugh or not but then I started talking to you about my work and uh other completely and consequential stuff and and you just listen like you really wanted to hear and then I know it sounds it sounds a little corny but by dessert I don't really know I wanted everything with you like the house the garden the child the the getting old together I wanted all of it and later you insisted on paying to I don't know make up for being late so I excused myself and went to the bathroom Robin?

      " Okay. A couple things. So I'll be in the room at the beginning just to make sure that you see a door, a window and a bookshelf. Okay. That's correct and it fills me that window right by. Okay. You're going to see a red or a green line above your head. Green means you can talk. Red means you can't talk. Okay. We usually tell people to wait for him to finish just because it makes it easier. When you speak at this level, if you speak like this, that's right. So you need to have a little bit of voice in to make sure that you're there. When everything happens in this room and that next room, once you're in that room, you stay over there. Okay. The story should tell you when to move that way, but if it doesn't, don't worry. I'll be here just to tell you when it's time to move. When you use the table, make sure that you get a nice little knock. It'll make sense when you put it in. And then for the rest of it is explore. Okay. Cool. Thank you. Okay. You should be in the main room. Okay. Okay. So door? Door. Yes. And book. Okay. So you reach the Garfield counter-medicine? Okay. Okay. So door. Door. Yes. And book. Okay. So you reach the Garfield counter-medicine? Okay. Okay. So you reach the Garfield counter-medic answering service? At the sound of the bird, leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Okay. Hi, sweetheart. It's not. That's the job of the company. You know, overall, it's not. But when that's done, the day you do need to call that one to the world. Come right here, we're about to get a Christmas. Maybe you're a nun. Oh, I'm more big. Can you remember Super Junior? Just take a shower. The one to meet you. I'll talk. Thanks. Good. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee, or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. I'm a big... I'm a big... I'm a little bit... I really need to work my life. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but since we're eating out anyway, what do you think sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Uh... Italian. Wow, I didn't expect that reaction. That's a surprising choice. It really shows how it works. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. That's a surprising choice. It really shows how unpredictable our cravings can be. It might lead to something amazing we never considered. That's unexpected. It's wild how we can stumble upon something new and exciting in the most unlikely places. Okay. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariagat. So there I am this morning, a little gumba summons me to her office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed, and how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. The gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too got-gummed scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going, but for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me, and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal, but I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me right in the office, so I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing, I'm all lost in the soup and market, so of course I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number dials, and I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and then the arm goes off. Screen on the front panel and I say it's low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over and then it's like I've killed it, it makes the kiddie's grinding noise inside, and notes she goes full in the blur in the excess distance, so I was harming to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's fire in paper, I was at our sendin alarm sounding, and I just started rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like RTX in the swanter sadness, and little goombas there with them, she doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and I asked hold, that was it, they fired me on this pot, I mean it's just the job, but you know, I really wanted other than, just to knock myself in making an impression if you want. Is there any chance the jacket is out there? I could really use it right now. Yes, it's out here. Hello? What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? You look great. Thanks, I just want to feel good about myself, especially with the date coming up, it's all a bit nerve-wracking to be honest. Is the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Janajakt, be honest? You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this, something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the gate I played and she's just really cool. She's stoned to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like a cross between Brook Shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just very smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there and it started raining on the way like thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant I looked like I don't know a cat that had just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like what's her name. Adrian in Rocky is nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more so I'm just blowering at her. I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow they'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word and age raise and then. Oh Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just oh god it just died on me and later when I'm ordering it's this Italian place. I say something done asking for some G knocky or something equally ignorant and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron and she's just just laughing and so I figuring that's it I'm dead I'm done and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool them just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction why's wrong with you. But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally goes via let the opportunity to speak and she just talks talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was time to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I were late so violently used to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home and the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole G knocky gate summons over the matinee and violets about to come back any second now I'm convinced this guy has it against me so I've gotten no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks back in and I'm still all my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering thank you to the major day and so somehow I had to get out of it so surely I can't mess it up twice in a row can I she's really special thanks for coming at such short there is I just I've got this this thing it's for violent she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that expresses what she actually means to me and I just I can't get it on the path what'd you do when when you're mentally blocked maybe I'll just show you what I've got I have this melody but I don't know I don't know where it's going I mean I like it but where is this leading sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job what my dad says I mean tell me how to do it you know tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I'm just maybe I'm just not good at this maybe that's it this is the universe tell them you to just stop and do something different alright let me try again what do you think maybe this come on come play with me come on don't be scared that's it that's it keep going keep going that's the path himself What you doing over there? Come here. Got to ask you to introduce new ones you can try. Shall we ask this one for kids? Vera, what is your second birth..? What's your second birth? Get started. Here are one more. veil and manoes of one heart. Here's one upward lead-up. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but Violet's sends a love, she's on the line so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worst hosts ever, we're just joking about stuff and then Violet came part and she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to type the old person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Because it is, Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's my look. I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this moment and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical for them. It keepsake from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know, about whatever, like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know now. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older, you know? See, it was around him when he'd pay. So, grab a pen, a slip of paper, you can pin them on that board there. Why did you do this? I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are doing from it. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at all rate, I remember things from my childhood. You know, it seems like the dawn. It made me realize what a temple or thing that we're in. Be with all rate. It reminds me of being with my sister, but there she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parent's part. And that place was like, well, you're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave the eight of them, really behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that's her family again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for our own. Something permanent. Etching and just stirring so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is a lake, is he? Just a sack. I'm going to see you too. Maybe you can meet him. He's in too company. Hi, hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? He missed two days. It's not a big violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no, if he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Two days will kill to see the world where you get. But that's not fair. No, no, no, no, look violet. Violet listen to me. Look, I... Well, did I speak this later? I have people arriving, so no, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. The others find. Speak up. Fish. Oh, sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? You sort of hear. Silence is an answer to. Sometimes it's the best one. Things are just, you know, massive. Yeah, I'm trying to... be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventional. Violet just looks like that. I don't know. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the origin you got? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. But we figured what the hell are taking with me. He never been to the US because that all his crisps just came off. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swatts with the big bands that like the concept. Exclusivity. But I knew you'd have some downcrackers. Be a bit. Explore the city. Get Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and to the mat of court-sighted tickets at the nap day. I loved it. The screen photos does also fit. And we stayed up late the shows. But it was him dragging me out bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. Another new I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to mean. Not just the good rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. Don't worry. What's the one thing that you'd never want to forget? I mean it's fascinating to think about what really sticks with us, you know. It's a tricky question. I don't know. Well I suppose it would be those small moments. Like laughter with Auri. They linger in the heart don't they? There's something about the fleeting nature of time isn't there. It's like every moment carries a weight and we just hope to hold onto the ones that truly matter. Are you okay? Yes I think I am. Just reflecting on things, you know. Life has a way of reminding us of what's important especially with family. Not much. That's lucky for me. It's just hard sometimes. I think you know everything. Being a dad, being me. I'll tell you about the climate. Please. No please, please don't. I can't. Please just for a moment. I don't remember it. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Oh wow though. Wow. Oh, oh no. Oh no no no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're an idiot. You never let them see. Say... Do. They. No. Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My gods you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Um... You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He... He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch so... They're definitely in here uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. I don't know where. I don't know where. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Uh... They could be in the bookshelf. Or... Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or... Or maybe under the table. Um... How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the flant. Or the... I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. Oh... To yeah, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've goodnessed me, huh? I've been writing my memoirs. They're just difficult because I'm... And I'm losing everything, things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh... I... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. Oh, the recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. I... I do that. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, and so I couldn't just raise it a check. Then finally, this young man bussles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me, you're shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of something. We just met, but there was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, weighed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I remember thinking, my god, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I was enraven of myself and then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and there's other completely inconsequential stuff and you just listen, like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late, so I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Well, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. No, please, this was my first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of my fool. Please. Got such a. This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true and my day's gonna come back here and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one and uh, with this bracelet, it was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait, what if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh yeah, is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second, wait a second. So you think you're a baby copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That is copper, if you're here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave your, the bracelet and well and, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So, where did you go to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your, please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold, calling G-no-key, like it's plated gold and proscade of pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose, and cool and clean, and you, your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace, you're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win, you wanna read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depth, you can't repeat, you twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope, you think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. And under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misprocline, and your om dish duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your vet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked, and soaps your sim, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move, you missed, now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a matriot date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. You can't trick the Kendelman jar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mamma Mia in your plight. A Laura strones by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. You can move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead. Slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephawks, he's a great friend of now. He attests this big man, all those oranges, suspecting not hope, Nebraska, real under the radar. Slide, slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide, you know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide, that means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhawna, maa, kifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist, repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the tank. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, you why? But you just shook your head until me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. So you're red and you're little sons that covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The land on the flares, the base drops low. Time took a pause.\n",

      " Oh, okay. So you want to start bringing them in and just like put their stuff in. Okay. So you're going to see a red line or a green line sometimes. When it's green, it means you're an after-talk. When it's red, it means you're not after-talk. Please let him finish before you speak. There's a moment where you're going to move from this room to that room. If it doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I'll let you know when to go, but more than likely you'll start heading that way, not just do you feel a little much. At some point you're going to use this table. Make sure that you hit it properly. Don't be nice to it. And then last but not least is we reward exploration. Okay. So what are we going to touch? You can touch. What are you going to eat? What are you going to drink? You can drink. Okay. Nobody's watching. Nobody's watching. You know, you're good. That's a little more. Okay. Is that good? Yeah. So you should be in the lobby. So you should say a little behind you? Yes, I'll say the door. I'm going to go to Garfield Cato Maddox answering service. I have to say under the book leave your name, phone number and shoe size. I swear you know, it's not. I have to go with the cup of shit now. You know, we're all proud, but when that's done, you do, you do. You need to call those ones in a while. You can't wait to hear what the bad is here in Switzerland. We should have done to you all a couple more days. Just take it to shower. Just a few seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up before heading out. So what do you think? French, Italian, Chinese or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Right. We're not going with the usual sauce bats. All right. This place says anything you can call out. I ain't even know alien. You saw what happens when it flies back. Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, frontmariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. This trippercut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the...copy room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gulp gum scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set foot in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents, and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm, I am lost. I'm going to make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. He makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full in the blur in the access system. So I was harming to an ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out, it's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I hope I didn't leave it somewhere silly. Um, what do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? Yes, you should wear that. That looks so cool. Give us a spin. I appreciate that. Just... I'm just a bit nervous about how everything's going to get... Is the silence that I'm excited about? It's nice to have some support, you know, be honest. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gay tagline, and she's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they told you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really do anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... What's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more, so I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in edge-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I'd been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I'd try to lie in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G. Nockie or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I rag late, so... Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of god, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks back in, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the major day. And so, somehow, I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... This thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, like my dad says. Ha! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe not set. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. Maybe just... Ha! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting our e to bed. Yeah, be good. I don't want my eyes crossed out at all. Îì§thmus. E-case Trend Don't bite your eyes like a fool Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the time I've become pretty militant about sleep training and going to the game with him and you're crushed. By the sense of love she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us and I know I know worse her cellar, but just juggling a bit of stuff at the moment. While it came partner and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical for me to keep safe from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you've mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever. Life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older, you know. See it was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know whether I did a cake from it. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ori and remembering from my childhood. You know, it seems like for God. It made me realize what a simple thing memory is. You, with Ori, must be of being with my sister, with her. There she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents start. And that place was like, well, you sort of saved me to this in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave the aching and the need behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etching to stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is weak, isn't it? Just to say, I'll go see you and maybe you can meet him if he's in too grumpy. Hi, hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, Timmy and Bray, miss two days. It's not a big. Violet, it's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the book. Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Listen to yourself for a second. No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Two days of kill to see the world away you get. Violet, that's not fair. No, no, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I hope people are not. No, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah, the others. Fine. Speak now. Fitch. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say either. Something just don't have any answers to that. Things are just, you know, messy. I'm trying to be a good father, so make it work in a pretty situation. I don't see all either often. You know, especially with Torian all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but Violet just went to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the old New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell I'll take him with me. We'd never been to the US, because all his Christmas's came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together, me and him, explore the city, and get Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and until the maps are caught, I take it to the nap to the end. I was just a few things to do. He stayed up late for the shows, but he was him dragging me out of bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to already to know what he needs to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon from me, not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm worried. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think memory is shape us. I've just seen a green line, experiences with my kids. That's what I went to remember. Music, concerts, ingrained in history, safer. It's safer there. Where do I go? Where do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. They don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. He was just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. They're just... I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the dharma thing. I was so embarrassed that I was so embarrassed. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was running 15 minutes late. I started to worry that you wouldn't have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. The idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. We didn't have cell phones back then. I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. If I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. It was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. Although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling and I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peaking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first date, I usually only involved small talk. I now remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke that I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date. And I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, please. I'll think of a fool. Please. But you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. There's a copper here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave Europe with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, and you're... We're going to gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll in sleep, but the seams don't hold. Calling Geno-key like it's plated, gold and proscato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean at you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You'll never see a sticker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi, the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your face. You're still a bit more than a star. You're still a bit more than a star. You're still a bit more than a star. And hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sim. You play a slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle and soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of County Port. I've seen a more walk out the door. I set the table. Tune the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, note day, then I can count. From broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And this dare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trast of array. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the Kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia. In your plight. Allora strones. By a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left to right. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account and witness protection. And we'd better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo. He's a great fan now. He attests big men all those oranges, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. Ma, the oh, na, ma, gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist, repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. The wind blows. The wind blows. The wind blows. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The time. Thank you. It's wonderful.\n",

I meant to clean up, but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. What do you feel like eating? We could do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. Burgers for sure. Burgers, for sure. Yeah. You're talking my lines. Sweet. I was thinking the same thing. Nothing beats a greasy burger and fries after a long week. You know, I have some news to share with you guys later. But let's go get the others first. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just as sight me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make it good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming in from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm as singing. Am I last in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says no aim. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. That is like I've killed it. And then I make this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the excess. So I was hobbitin' ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little gumbers there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew and I asked hold. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? The jacket? I was worried I'd lost it. I need it for tonight. I think you're sure it. I think it looks good. I lost the sheet in thisstad that's giving off 1987<|tr|> king of quintessence all we need. I remember he delivered it in summer and you were like, we're good, aren't we? I think you sure I think it looks good Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time Her name's Byron and I met her one the gate applied and she's just really cool She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like Across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just really smart So they'll tell you about what happened on the first day God I was so late Lord knows how long she been waiting man I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there and it started raining on the way like Thundering down so by the time our family's staggering to the restaurant I look like I don't know a cat that just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and Sort of still and I'm panicking obviously so I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really do anything She's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's an aadrin in Rocky as nice as that kind of gentle demeanour is It makes me have an compensate even more so I'm just blowering at her I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying I think I was running about my music and how Chris Isaac storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath Let alone and I'll hurt to get a word in age raise and then Jesus Let us sort of realize that I've been talking non-stop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just All it just died on me and later when I'm ordering it's this Italian place I say something done asking for some G. Nockie or something equally ignorant and the way to just staring at me like I'm a moron And she's just Starts laughing and so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head You You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool to just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction wise wrong with you But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally gives violent the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about her and her creative intent when she's designing and The music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just Spellbound thinking My god this girl is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and Till it was planned to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so Violet leads to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole G. Nockie gate summons over the major day and Violets about to come back any second now convinced this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to say Right, so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just If they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as violent works by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major D and so somehow I had to get out of it so Surely I got mess up twice in a row can I? She's really special Wait for a minute, so sure there is I just I've got this this thing It's for Violets. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that Expresses what she actually means to me and I just I can't get it on the path What you do when when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got I have this melody I don't know I Don't know what's going I Mean I like it but Where is this leading Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says I mean Tell me how to do it you know tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I'm just Maybe I'm just no good at this Maybe that's it This is the universe tell them me to Just stop and do something different You just Let me try again What do you think Maybe this Come on Completely That's it Keep going keep going that's the path You You You You You You What you doing All right Maybe something I'm just putting on There's You You Hey, sorry about that I I really wanted to meet you all but By the night I'm putting a minute in the last week training and Going to the gym with him and you're crushed By the center of my she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us and I know I know worse house ever We're just Juggling a bit of stuff at the moment While it came part and she's under a lot of pressure She and I were Like ships in the night My music is taking off a bit which is great obviously but Sometimes Sometimes you don't have long enough to take the old person in to take care of already Anyway Look Everything's great Really It is Ory He's amazing He's like Best day of my life every day It's my Look I had this idea I wanted you to Well It's a bit of a favor Always burst those coming up later this month and I was thinking about how People don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives And I wanted to create something physical about it It keeps it from this part of his existence And I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message It can be whatever you like it doesn't have to be a birthday message I think it's better just about something that you know About whatever like You know What you know now or what you wish you'd know that I think it'd be really cool for when it's older You know See it was around in my new place So Rub a pen, I slipped a paper You can pin them on up or that I think you could do this I think he's gonna love it I don't really know what they are and they're painful It's sort of weird When I spend time with Orin I remember things from my childhood You know things I've forgotten It may be realized It's what a temple is saying in memory of me He was Orin He must be being with my sister, maybe There she is Not pitching She and I used to play in this forest Behind our family home This was the former parents thought And that place was life Well It was sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way I guess because it was like hours and Whenever we went there we'd leave the aching and the need behind And become other people Live otherwise Because we were kids Right? So We're literally living in our imaginations of that We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous One day we really got lost of that We had a path that we always took to get in and out And she just Straight, I guess It was the worst thing I've ever experienced I think that she found her again pretty quickly But it felt like an eternity at the time And I was young and You have no real sense of consequence of that age What it means to actually lose something that that day Carried out completely Just how easy it is to lose something that you love I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you Something permanent Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake as he Just a sec I guess he too, maybe he can meet him He's into grumpy Oh, I, I have that little buddy Daddy's here Daddy's here Oh, give me a break Missed two days It's not a big Violet, it's shared custody But how long are you going to see him as is? No, no If he misses a couple days of school Because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son It's not actually the end of the wood What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous It's not like he's been Do you listen to yourself for a second? No, you don't understand Violet And actually, it's a love to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you She's the thing she's told to see the world the way he gets Violet, that's not fair No No, look Violet Violet, listen to me, look out I'm going to have to keep this later I hope you're providing some No, I'll Yeah Okay Okay, yeah Yeah, that's the time Fitch Oh Sorry, I didn't I didn't hear you those comments How much did you hear about? Enough You're ready to head out, huh? Things are just, you know, messy Yeah, I'm trying to To be a good father To make it work in a pretty shitty situation I don't see all either often You know Especially with Torin all the time Well I'm approaching it a little unconvincially Violet just went to hear like that Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin of York? He loved it We only had a couple of shows And it was very last minute But it figured what the hell I'll take him with me He'd never been to the US Because all his Christmas's came at once And there were some small shows Small, acoustic swaps for the big bands That like the concept of exclusivity But I knew he'd have some down time And we spent all that time together Me and him Explore the city And get Korean food for the first time I took him to sleep no more And to the mat So I'm caught sight tickets at the nap day Love that The screenfamous does awesome, though And he stayed up late The shows But it was him dragging me out of bed in the morning Because he wanted to go out and do more And see more I never knew what I meant to my father And we didn't have much of a relationship I actually left But I want to know what he needs to mean I want in time Memories that he looks upon the family Not just the rock star father that was never there Half the time I think that's all that we are I'm ready What's the one thing that you'll never want to forget my friend? Some days I think about the things I'll leave behind too Never want to forget the past Memories with loved ones That's what I always come back to Memories with loved ones Never want to I'll tell you about the climate to go eight in New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. She's gone. Troic decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I've found them there before. Or the drawers. Or in the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Edges. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware. I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkest thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. So you were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat. It was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidewayed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braving of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. And then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I had a completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I, uh, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And, uh, or this bracelet, it was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So, what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold calling G-no-key. Like it's plated gold and proscato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you, your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slicked me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promised to return babe, give it a week, I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope, you think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one mis-reply, and you're on dish-duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaks your sim, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope, she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I'm a master of array, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kendelman jar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mama Mia in your plight. A Laura Strong's by a fancou, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. Okay, bye, read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection, and we'd better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's, he's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all those oranges, practically not for Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. Paolo tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Ma, the oh, na, ma, gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist repo, eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling, and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried, that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. And this was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair, the bass drops slow, time to compose. Now it's red. That's as far as you got it. All right. Cool, man. You're the first person to actually see the full video. That's cool. That's super cool. Can't take his own video. Yeah. Oh man, look at that.\n",

      " That's correct and that means that the position is correct. You will see a green light or a red light sometimes above your wiser. That means that when it's green you can talk, when it's red you are not allowed to. We always say try to let him finish his faces but sometimes you will speak and you just get in the middle of it. You'll start in this room. At some point you're going to move to the other room. Once you're in that room you stay in that room. Usually it's pretty clear when you need to move but the more about it if it's not clear I'll make sure that you're not space. When you speak speak at this level. At some point you're going to use this table. Make sure that you knock it but try to be cute with it right now. Give it a visit all. Last but not least we reward people that explore and go around. Great. When you're good. Yeah. Just try to make sure that you're good. Yeah. Yep. When you reach the girl you'll get her medocans. At the sound of the bird leave your name, phone number and shoe size. Switch to your old friend. You know your old friend took me to the school I wanted a while. Can't wait to hear about it. You're a Christmas meet you with a puppy. Or a fun fun thing. You remember to bring that cake cake. Just take it a shower. Just have a drink or whatever. Just don't drink or my beer. Take me, take me, take me, a big hug. Hello, Reddit. I really need to work my hard pitch. Just a few seconds. Sorry about the mess. I'm not going to clean up. Where do you want to go? French, Italian, Chinese or slum it and go for burgers? Any pizza? We could hit that new pizza joint downtown. I've been meaning to try it out. I heard their slices are huge and their music selection is pretty cool. Sounds good. Let's go for a pizza and slices and everything in between. I'm so down for that. I'm starving. Let me just grab my walkman and we can head out. I've got the latest from Durandoran on cassette. Not really a fan of Durandoran, do anything more recent? No worries, dude. I've also got some fresh prints and the police on tape. That should get us going for the ride over to the pizza rear. Just picked up the new Bon Jovi album. Slippery when wet. It's totally rocking. Want to give it a listen on the way. Yeah, anything more modern? You're going to love this. I've got the latest from Rundi MC, Raising Hell. It's like nothing you've ever heard before. Hip hop is blowing up. Man is good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. The publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cup, I forget copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. I'm too got gumbed scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set, but in the ivory fucking tower. I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow I... I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents, and I'm lining the number down, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost, I'm gonna make it. And then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low, aim. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notice she goes full into blur in the access system. So I was in the harbor to ink, like everywhere, on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was asked, to send an alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like artics in the swam to sadness, and little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They hired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to knock mess up and make an impression if you want. Can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door. Yes. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? No, I think you're going to be too cold. I didn't even think about that. It's pretty chilly outside, isn't it? I just grab a sweater instead. Alright. Silence speaks louder than words. Yeah, I'll go get one. We don't want to be late for the others. They're probably already waiting. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? Yes. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one day gay tech player and she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between broad shields and Jennifer Connelly. And she's just really smart. So they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting, man. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... what's an age-ren? In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have in common say even more. So I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get in word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G-Knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but f*** it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. And finally, it goes viral at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and... her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spelbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so f***ing cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so why not at least go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks that I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate, someone's over the major day. And violets about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatch for a means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'd just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it but... When is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean... Say! Tell me how to do it. You need to chill out, man. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to step and do something different. Maybe I'm just... Come on! I'm gonna try again. What'd you think? Count here, isn't it? I'll go and go. This? Come on. Come play with me. I don't think you've got to be out of my mind. Come on, move this way. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on our eat-a-bad. Support I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I become pretty militant about sleep training and going to the game with them and you got crushed. By the time it sends a love, she's on deadline. So she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse host ever. We're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. She fell it came harder and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. I know the feeling pal. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes, sometimes we don't have long enough to type the other person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. He really is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. Always burst those coming up late at this moment. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. You know, see what he was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, I'll just slip the paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what the idea came from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time in Orey, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was already. He must have been with my sister a minute. There she is. I'm a picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents part. That place was like, well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. We'd become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we literally got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something. I mean, I'm getting a bit of a... Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something with that. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, I'm getting... The most place I've ever been. TXR 55 isn't this morning. Yeah. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That's interesting. Let's go this way. Yeah. Sorry. Just press the quid and that. Oh, is that? Yeah. Just quid. Yeah. Yeah. All right. And then actually, can you click the Unreal on the... Yeah. Yeah, should be the lobby. Yeah. It's interesting. Technology, eh? It was like just as the... This headset has been working perfectly. And suddenly it's just... It's been a little bit angle. It's just that when the far has appeared, then it all kind of... Oh, yeah. Yeah, we know that. Okay. Yeah. Technology. Technology. Then we do the lobby. I'm in the lobby, a lobby man. That should go with dark. Yeah. Still lobby man is the lobby man, okay? That's even dark. Still lobby man. Come on, dark night. Piano. What are you doing over there? Here we go. Okay, come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on our heat to bed. The lights of the gold The bright lights of the stars The lights of the light And tell me if you want me How I love you If you remember me How I love you If you remember me How I love you If you remember me If you remember me If you remember me How I love you If you remember me I always love you. There he is. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But by the night I become pretty militant About sleep change I'm going to begin with and we're not crushed. By the centre of the mud She's on the deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse than us. We're just joking about stuff And then By the way, she came out and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were Like ships in the night. My music is taken off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag me a person in to take care of our Anyway, look. Play some music. Everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mud. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, It's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this moment. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories From the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know. See what he's around him when he's made it. So, rather than slip the paper, You can pin them on that board there. Like you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are playing for. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Ori, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He was already. He runs me a bean with my sister with it. There she is. Not pictures. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents' job. And that place was like, Well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right?

And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something. But that day, I can't find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something in your life. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't he? Here he comes. I'll go see you too. There's maybe a meeting. He isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, can we have break? It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No. I think he misses a couple days of school. But now I want to take him on tour. Quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Do you listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a love maker decision, but I've won every single fucking detail by you. I'm not a mention. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. We're going to have to pick this later. I have people right now, so. No, I'll do it. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Fidget. Oh. Jesus. Still a rock star. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I think I heard the whole thing. How are the problems sharing the kid? It's just... I never thought this is my life for taking it. It's tough when things pile up, isn't it? Sometimes I wonder if we're meant to carry all that weight alone. I'm trying to... To be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all that often. Especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Can't hear it, but still. I just feel like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took the origin of young? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US because all his Christmases came at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And Keck Kareen through for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and to the mat to have courtside tickets at the nap time. I loved it. The streamfermist does also have that. He's still up late for the show. He was driving me out of bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks confundly. He's not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing you would never want to forget? I think it's those moments that shape us, that linger in our hearts. Yeah, easy to remember the big moments but harder to remember the small ones. It's important to hold on to those memories, isn't it? They connect us to who we are and they remind me of the joy and pain we all share. The small ones, they often slip through the cracks, don't they? Yet I believe they weave the fabric of our lives creating a tapestry richer than we realize. Yep. Those fleeting moments, they can be like whispers in the night. I cherish them, knowing they hold so much meaning, even if they seem insignificant at first. You probably should have spent more time with Ori than, didn't you? I often think about that, how time slips by. I want to make sure I'm truly present for him, to create more of those small, beautiful moments together. That's what matters most in the end, isn't it? It's hard to say you have a bit of making up to do. Let's talk about the climate that I ate in your. You did yet. Tell me that already. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision, probably. Definitely smart. She was, always was. And of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. Oh, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. Think. Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. Thanks very much. Oh, look, the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. Oh, yeah. Good night, Gray. You just missed Ari, he was just here. I'm just looking at him. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshop. Or in the cabinet, I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. Oh, the table, six. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... I don't like it. Or the piano. Now, I'll let you check, there, a minute. Or the plant. I'm so sorry, I have to come so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I'm good with this, mate. I've been writing my memoirs. Yeah. Difficult because I'm losing everything, things. I always did, though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? I used to play in it. Yeah, you told me I have a foredory with it. But what's scary? Oh. I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me boister notes. The calling is what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Byelot the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh, yeah. God, I did this. It is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I was into the restaurant and you weren't there, and I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, and you were sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously. But, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only aware of me, of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're all demeanor. Shept it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segueed into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So, now, remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. This is him, I'll be back. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really dating. I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom, so if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And for you, I'll have a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfeet here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. If you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trast of a ray. You played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the condelman. Jaram Velvitz in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama Mia in your plight. A Laura strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. I'm a man. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right, but we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He says more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. I would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's. He's a Craig Fender now. He tests this big man, old orange, expecting not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. My the old namage. Give me a guard. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist, repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. But I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bay. The bay. The mandolin flair. The bay. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's it. That's a fun. Thank you very much. Thank you. That was cool. Yeah, lots of the process.\n",

French Italian Chinese or should we just slum it and grab some burgers? Oh French. May we? I didn't expect that. French cuisine would be a real treat though. Yes, it would. That's a bit unexpected, but I'm all for it. A nice night out with some fancy food sounds like a great way to spice things up. That's such a pleasant surprise. I'm all in for something a little more upscale tonight. Okay. Like... I can already imagine the delicious dishes we might get. French food always has a way of making an evening feel special, doesn't it? Yes. French cuisine definitely has that. Yes. She doesn't say que. The anticipation of a delightful meal just adds to the excitement. Let's make some unforgettable memories over a tasty dinner. Every moment spent with good food and friends is a chance to create lasting memories. It's all about enjoying life to its fullest, right? Yes. Man, it's good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Oh, sorry. You can't go back out. Are the publishing house? Well... The head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of... Sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, uh... What's it called? Little gumba. You know, for a mario cut? So, there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to us with our actions. So, I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the exetive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So, I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So, I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. I just start the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling from me back in the office. So, I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the du-box is playing, and Joe Stummer singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So, of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it. And I'm loading off all the documents, lining the number down, and I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. Screen on the front panel says, no, I mean. So, I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. And then I make this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full in the blur and the access to this. So, I was holding her in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out of this house and an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me. It's standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our texts in the swanters sadness. And little goombas there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, I know I was whole. That was it. They fired me on this top. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I think I might have left it near the door. Did you like it? Yes. Now I'd like to recite another song that I wrote. It's just called, girls just want to eat cheese. Oh, mommy dear, you know that I need to eat from the four basic true groups every day. That's right. Girls just want to eat cheese. Oh, girls, that's all they want to do. Girls just want to eat cheese. Um, what do you think? Oh. Yeah, it's very cool. Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Yeah, is that the ink jacket? Yes, that's the one. Oh, okay, cool. Low response? It's definitely good. I just want to make sure everything's perfect for the day. It is. It's very good. Oh, try that one. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Many times. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something neutral. Yeah, it looks good. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Yeah. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gay tag plate. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in. I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the major det. And so somehow I had too much to get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row. Can I? Cheese, really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a berthic coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. I just can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody about me. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music get going. Yeah, proper job. Like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stalk and do something different. Let me just... Come on. Let me try again. Yeah, try again. What do you think? Yeah, it's good. Maybe this? Come on. Nice and... Completely. It's nice and soft and... Come on, don't miss that. Okay, nope. That's it. That's the one. Keep going. That's the path. Come here. Come here. It's all set home. Can I just put it down to get going? Yeah, that's the other room. The other one. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. Yeah, you go ahead. Okay, thank you. Okay. I'm going to do a little bit of music. Something happened. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But... ...fight a lot. I'm going to do a little bit of music. Something happened. Hey. Sorry about that. I want to do a little bit of... ...fight a lot. I'm pretty millited about street trading. I'm going to begin with them and get crushed. But it sends them up. She's on her mind. So she won't be able to do more of that. I know we're doing whatever. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. night. My music stayed hot for a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of already. Anyway, everything's great. Really it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, this is a bit of a failure. I always birth this kind of late into my, and I was thinking about how people don't bring up memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for me. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know about whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know, see what he's about to do when he's a baby. So, brother Penn, I slipped a paper, you can pin them on that board that. I tried to put you through this. I don't really know what the idea came from. He's sort of weird. I'm gonna spend time at Ori. I remember things from my childhood. You know, it seems like the dawn. Okay. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He was already, he wants me being with my sister a minute. There she is. I'm not picking. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was before my parents died. And that place was like, well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave it aching and then leave behind and become other people. Live otherwise. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that's from founder again pretty quickly. We felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to try to lose something that day. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etching and just stirring so it can't be lost, right? Okay. So... Oh, the master is awake, is he? I'll go see to them. Maybe he can meet him. He isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. It's over there. It's kind of on its own. Yeah, okay. That's fine. We know about this box. And then can you press so that you can quit? With this one. Oh, sorry. This one. Can you see the menu? It does not know enough? Mm, plus theÁîú, the metalitation for a second then, it disappears. It's just 2 packets, it's gone to it. Okay, let's wait a bit. And when it reads, it's really annoying. Thank you for any help. That is alright. Just likeaved,lette. So really annoying bug that we're trying to fix. I know and I want to say it's just one of those things but honestly I won't knock it from that to click. Both that and I and any events that we go to with the headsets we've had many turn on turn on. We're trying to get it so it doesn't happen all the time. It just happens sometimes which is what we're trying to figure out is why. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Let me know. You should go talk now. I'm just talking about the character now. Thank you. Oh, can you break? Missed two days. Small big. Finally. What I hardly get to see him as is. No. No. I'm taking on talk and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand by that. I'm actually allowed to make a decision. Why don't you just tell the world the way you get? No. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving so... No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, no. Speak. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. No, I was. Yeah, that's okay. How much did you hear about? Some... Some of it. Oh, good. Violet and I... Yeah. Been through a lot. I think I got to go all out. Things are just... You know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't... I don't even know either of them. That's her. Especially with Torin all the time. Yeah. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Okay. Violet just went to see you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took away from you? No. He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but... He figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. Yeah, cool. He never been to the US. It was like all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small... Acoustic Swats for the big bands that liked the concept of... Exclusivity. Yeah. But I knew he'd have some downpire. Very important. All that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. And... He had Korean food for the first time. Yeah. I'm looking to sleep no more and... And to the mat I've caught sight tickets at the nap again. Yeah. Did you like the city? Loved it. The stream phone does awesome, though. And he stayed up late. The show's back. It was Kim dragging me out of bed in the morning because... He wanted to go out and do more and see more. No, well that's what you do on holiday. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And... We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to make. I want him to have memories that he looks on the family. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Well I'm sure he does with you taking time to travel. After time I think that's all that they are. Memory. Memory. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think it's those moments that define us. Yeah. There was moments that define us. Wow, okay you've dropped that. I mean did you at least hear the part I made a good point? Yes. I'll tell you about the time I took our eight in York. Yes. Please. Please don't. I can't. Please just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, oh no. Oh no, no, no, where is she? Did I? Did I really? Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You're blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. That's okay. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. Who's helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... I'm definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... I really? Would you help me find them? I really? Yes. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, cheer, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? No. Oh, that was good. Oh, you did. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. I was always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, wait into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So now, remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I got him, really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. I was sitting on the pan before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I shall think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Geno? Got such hair. This guy says he lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. We have that policy that... You might watch but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what we're going with. Do you think that's going to cover a tree cause new? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfield. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So where did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get it. Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or prying off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you. I'm going to be a great man. I'm going to be a great man. I'm going to be a great man. I'm going to be a great man. My name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep but the seams don't hold. Calling Geno key like it's plated gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean and huge. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You tried to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet but I've got depth. You can't repeat, you twitch, you grin. You check the bill, no wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one mis-reply. And you're on dish-duty. No ale by the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sim. You play a slick, but here's the twist. One wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a morw walk out the door. I set the table to in the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save punoctay that I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare, you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your meal. The same trast of array. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the kindelman. Jar, I'm velvet. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mia in your plate. Allora strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left to right. But we start here. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? This has more lockups than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meeport. He's a Craig Fender now. He attests this big man, all those oranges, back in Opopna, Braska. Real under the Rada. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know that there's any more. Left falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Ma the orna ma. Oh, kiffigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And we were at a nilo sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The time.\n",

      " Start recording. Or... Code. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Hi, where are you? Good morning. Thanks very much. Welcome. Thank you and I called you to incorrect me and I asked you for the way around. So I apologize. It's alright. So a couple of things. Obviously in a perfect place, you would have been outside and there would be a door before you enter this room. Okay. But infrastructure. So we're like this. Yeah. No? When we begin, I'll be in the room with you. Okay. You should see a door, a window, in a bookshelf. Okay. Once you see those three things, it means that you're in the correct room and I can leave. Okay. The experience happens in this room at the next room. At some point, you will be moved to that room and then you stay there for the rest of the experience. Okay. It should be clear in the story but if it isn't, don't worry. I'll be here to tell you when to go. Okay. You will see a red line and a green line sometimes above the headset. Okay. When it's green, it means you're a large talk. When it's red, it means that you kept. Okay. Okay. Good to know. When you speak at this level, no need to shout, but if you speak like this. Okay. So, you know. Okay. Well, hopefully I will do... That's good. This is a good level for it. Okay. When you use the table, make sure that you give it a nice knock. Okay. It'll make sense. Okay. And then last but not least, just making sure I told you everything. Yeah. The whole place is game you're allowed to touch, play, grab. When you grab things, try to grab them like this. Yeah. Like that. Okay. Yep. I'll remember that because I usually do. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Thank you very much. Too bad. I got to write this time. All right. Let me know when you are comfortable. Yes. That's cool. Perfect. All right. See you here we go. So now you should see... You see the Garfield Catomatic Answering Service. Thank you so much for the work. Do you see the door? Yes. Do you see the window? Yes. And you see the bookshelf? And yes. Perfect. You can move it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It was just a golden one. It's a golden one. You can probably move it like that. Or a golden one. You can move it like this. It's a golden one. The one that you can move like that. Thank you. Are you just having a golden one? Just a drink on my knee. Okay. Just a drink. Just a drink. Just a few seconds. Hello. Sorry about the man. Oh, it's okay. I got caught up in the moment. So what sounds good for dinner? I have a challenge. Or should we just slum it and grab some burgers? Oh, a friend. May we? I want that. What do you expect? A French cuisine with the real treat, though. Yes, it would. That's a bit unexpected, but I'm all for it. And I'm going to have some fancy food. So I'm going to spice things up. That's such a pleasant surprise. I'm all in for something a little more upscale tonight. Okay. Like... I can already imagine the delicious dishes we might get. French food always has a way of making the beef and the special, doesn't it? You're touched. It doesn't even definitely have that. Yes. She doesn't say que. The anticipation of a life from meal just adds to the excitement of the beef. Let's make some unforgettable memories over a tasty dinner. Every moment spent with good food and friends is a chance to create lasting memories. It's all about enjoying life to its fullest, aren't it? Yes. It's good to see you, right? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Intention. Oh. Sorry, you didn't work out. It's... Are the publishing house? Well, to the original value. The head of my department, she's called Sarah. And... Oh, ex-aguration. The moment is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or maybe it's just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. And she's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, Fr. Moriaca. So there I am this morning, and Little Gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And now she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. The gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be Little Gumber, but just finding these things like an authoritarian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, in the places in total layers. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gunned scared of Little Gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, standing there I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three flights of stairs, and across, and then I forget. And suddenly I realise I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-charmishine types in suit are either of these. And I know I'm not supposed to ever reset the building that I've been fucking tired of. So I just keep my head down and try to make up like everything's normal. I know the copy rooms in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path, find the path. Like I'm in Indiana Jones by this point. You know, I'm gonna start the film when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear Little Gumber yelling for me right in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the du-box is playing in Joe Strummer singing. I'm a last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents, lining the number down, and I'm thinking, Screw you Joe Strummer. I am lost, I'm gonna make it, then I'm gonna press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen and the float panel sets, no. So, I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by the idle, run over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes the city as blind and close inside. And notes you go full with the glare and the excess distance. I was hovered to ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's like paper every time I send an alarm sounding. The staff are rushing for the office to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like artics in the swamp of sadness. And little goob is there, but she doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, in the household. That was it. I only understand, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Could you check if my jacket is out there? I think I might have left it in the door. Do you like it? Yes. I'm trying to, to read side. Another farm today. To the wall. Girl, we just want to. We just want to. We just want to chase. I mean, dear, you know that I need to eat for the poor baby to eat for every day. That's right. Girl, we just want to eat cheese. Girl, that's all you want to do. We just want to eat cheese. What do you think? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's very cool. Is that any possible universe in which issue? Where is this for the day? Yeah, is that the ink jacket? Is that you? Oh, okay, cool. No response? It's definitely cool. I just want to make sure everything's perfect for the day. It is. It's very good. Oh, try that one. Many times. Yep, it looks cool. Yeah. I can. Wow. Oh. When does she get a cream? Who knows how long she could wait in there? I had to change after rehearsal. When I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers. There were a little bit too fitted. So I missed theÏãúÔøΩ and ended up being too runner. And it started grainy on the way, like, thunder-ing down. So by the time I finally staggered in to the restaurant, I looked like a cat that had just crawled out the urine all. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking obviously. obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's in an age ring in Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more so I'm just blabbering at her. I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how criticise it, storm my name and my plans for it and somehow they'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone and I'll heard to get a word in age raise and then oh Jesus. But I sort of realised that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so I just thought that I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just started on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something done asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron and she's just just laughing and so I figuring that's it. I'm dead undone and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? Look probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally gets violently opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is a whole fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it's time to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late so why at least to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet and the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole doo knocky gay someone's over the major day and violets about to come back any second now I'm convinced this guy has it against me so I've got no more dignity left to say right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me jeez I even promise them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks back in and I still want my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering thank you to the major D and so somehow I had to get out of it so surely I can't miss it twice in a row can I she's really special thanks for coming to such short notice just I've got this this thing it's for violent she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write or something something that expresses what she actually needs to be I just I can't get it on the path but what you do when when you're mentally blocked yeah I help this melody but I don't know I don't know what it's going I mean I like it but what is this leading sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go again top of the job like my dad says I mean tell me how to do it you know tell your friend or girlfriend husband or wife what actually means to you I'm like this maybe I'm just no good at this maybe that's it this is the universe telling me to just stop and do something different all right let me try again yeah try again what do you say yeah it's cool it's nice and it's nice and soft and okay no that's it that's the one that's the one keep going that's the path mmm Uh Hello Hello What are you doing over there? Come here. What are you doing over there? Come here. What are you doing over there? Come here. Make a sense of it. Just put that, just put it there. Yeah, just put it there. The other one. Yeah, just put it there. Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to take care of it quickly. Is that okay? Something happened? Hey. Hello. I really wanted it to meet you all. But five or nine of pretty well as in about three days. We had to get rid of your crush. Well, I said hello. She's on the line. She left me on the toilet. I know, I know, we're supposed to have a... We're just... ...just doing a bit of stuff in there. Okay. Well, it came apart and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were... ...like ships in a night. But we just came out from it, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... ...sometimes we go up long enough to tag me up, hurting me to take care of Ari. Anyway, look. Everything's great. Because it is Ari. He's amazing. It's like... ...that's the day of my life, every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...well... ...it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those kind of notes from it. And I was thinking about how... ...people that ring up memories for the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of the physical parts. Yeah. It keeps safe from this part of the existence. Okay. I was wondering if you could lie in a message. Oh, yeah. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about assuming that you know about what happened. Like, you know... ...if you know now or what you wish you knew about. I think it's a recall of the Zelda. Yeah. It's here in the mountain. So, a lot of pain, I just slipped the paper. I don't know about that. I think you could hear that. Oh, no pattern. I don't really know when I did a painful... ...it's so weird. When I spent time it already. I remember things from my childhood. It seems like you're gone. Okay. So... What's her fault that I remember? Even though I... ...monthly being with my sister, really. There she is. Not pitch. She... She almost played this for her. Behind a fun with her. This was... Not pitch, but... Well... ...you saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and... ...whenever we went there we believed in it and then we were hired. And become other people. Live on the line. Because we were kids, right? So... We're literally living in our imaginations of that. We've been bent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And... ...because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we remember we considered the idea that might be dangerous. Why don't you get a lot lost on that? We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... ...strowed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean... I think that she found her again pretty quickly. She was like an eternity in time. And I was young and... ...you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that's better. I can't believe it. Just how easy it is to lose something that you know. I guess that's why I want to have something that I... ...something permanent. Actually it's a stone, so it can't be lost, right? Okay. So... Oh, the master is awake, is it? I'm going to see to him. Maybe he'll be here. He's in too grumpy. Hi! Hi there, old buddy. That is here. That is here. That is here. ... Oh. Did it? It's just gone... ...just over there. It's kind of on its own. Yeah, okay. That's why we know about this box. Okay. And then can you press so that you can quit? So the master... With this one? Oh, sorry, this one. So quit. Can you see the menu? No. Can you see the menu now? It was there, the metal button for a second, but then it disappears. It's just two packets, like it's just gone to... That's the headset, I think. That's exciting. It's really annoying. It's really annoying, what? Thank you. I probably have makeup there. So I apologize. ... It's a really annoying bug that we're trying to fix. I know you want to say it's... It's just one of those things, but honestly, I won't... ...knock it for that two packets. Seconds. Both the H&I and the other events that we go to, with the headsets, we will have many turn-on, turn-off, so... We're trying to get it so it doesn't happen all the time. It just happens sometimes, which is what we're trying to figure out is why. There you go. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you so much. Okay, here we go. Let me know what. It should go dark now. Just at the end of the dark now, yet. Okay, thank you. Oh, can you pray? You missed two days. It's not big. Violent is shared custody. But I'm going to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school, because I want to take him on tour, he spends some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Do you listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violent. I'm actually allowed to make a decision with that. But yeah, we still fucking need to know Violent. Usually they just kill the whole of Vegas. Violent lost all that out. No. No, look Violent. Violent, listen to me. Look out. I'm going to have to pick this later, hey. I hope you play them. No, I'll. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Sweet. Bitch. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Did you guys come out? No, I raised. Yeah, that's okay. Did you hear it, but? No. Some of it. Oh, good. Violent and I... Yeah. Sorry to hear that. It still feels like we're trying to figure it out. Okay. Things are just... You know... Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. And... To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. Okay. I understand. That's her. Especially Victorian all the time. Yeah. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Okay. Violent just went to see her low back. Did I ever tell you about the time it's the origin you got? No. He loved it. He only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but... He figured what the hell... I'll take him with me. Yeah, cool. It was like all his Christmas just came once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that bite the concept. Exclusivity. Yeah. I knew he'd have some downfiring. Very important. All that time together. Me and Hit. Explore the city. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat. So I caught sight tickets at the nap. Did you like the city? I loved it. It's been very, very special. Instead of late the show. He's going to be our bed in the morning. Do more in his sea bowl. No, well that's what you do on holiday. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after that. But I want to know what he needs to make. I want him to have memories that it looks conformly. Not just the good rock star father that was never there. But you taking time to travel. That's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think it's those moments that define us. Yeah. There was moments that define us. Wow. Okay, you've done that. I mean, did you really hear that? Yes. I'll tell you about the thymacid that I ate in your... Yes. Please. No, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, where is she? Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough of that. It will be there with that... Of course it will. If you look... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're in idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. They. Note. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't madden. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the past. You have to. Oh. Yep. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in now. That's okay. Let me have a look at you. Yep. My cards, you look so well. You all look the same age. Seems to be only me that's getting older. Let me... Oh, you just missed Ari. He was just here. Oh, I'm sorry. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Yep, maybe. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. Oh, okay. I need them to read it lunch, so... There definitely is here. I'm certain of it. Okay. I'm aware. Okay. Let's see. Can you do it there? Yep. I will. Would you help me find them? I will. Yep. They could be in the bookshelf. Bookshelf, yeah. Oh, yeah. Or in the cover. I found them now, too. Bookshelf, bookshelf. Look. Oh, it's just a bit too obvious. Oh, so far. So far. Or maybe under the table. Table. How about the chair? Chair. Nope. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oops. Plant. Oh, look like that. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, no, pal, I'm... Oh, see if that isn't embarrassing. I have them the whole time in my pocket. Yep. Good. I think breaking my memoirs... That was difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I do that the time I lost my sister in Florence who used to play it? No. Oh, yes, you did. You did. I... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me your voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from five of the other day. It's the dumbest thing. I... I don't know. God, it is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running for two minutes late. But whenever I went into the restaurant, and you were there, and I started to worry that you would actually have to tell me how. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man lost his into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm not going to be late. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and un-Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. If I were likely feeling and I didn't know I immediately had a response, but you don't really start talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peaking behind a curtain of something. You just met that there was such openness about it that you felt almost into it. Like, you were completely neatly and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, way into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up them the most deeply. On my other first day so we should nail me in a small talk. When I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to shout and take your hand. But I was in braven of myself and then I think at that point, I was just feeling a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I've had completely a consequential stop and you just listen. I did really wanted to hear and I know it sounds a little corny but by dessert, I knew I would have everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. But ever? Oh yeah, I got him. I'm really sorry but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow to repay and I swear. What about your late friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was our first day and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. What's up, kid? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle it. We have the policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. Do you think that's going to cover a tree-course mood? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh yeah, is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Where are you deciding? So you think you're a baby copper floor, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That's a copper city. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so where did you go to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you're getting wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than their bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. We're probably not going to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight.

      " but no, okay, I have served last year, it's lovely there. I'm looking to listen. Great. How about five years ago? Okay. Right, so a couple of house things that are there. Yeah. Yeah, you can look at that. So originally, in the final piece, you will actually be outside getting prepped. Okay, yeah, yeah. You will see a door. And then once you're ready, you'll open that door and you will come into the space. Okay, very good. You can't put a door in there. Yeah, yeah. That's how you might as well start. Okay. When we begin, I will be inside. Okay. So then you can see a door. Yeah. A window. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah. At some moments, you're going to see a green line or a red line above your head. Okay, yeah. Green means you can talk. Red means you can't talk. Okay, yes. Usually is where he finishes before you talk. Okay, yeah. Most of the space happens in these two rooms. You'll be in this room first and then at some point, you'll move to that room. Okay. Once you're in that room, you stay in that room. Okay. If it's not clear when to move from this room to that room, or wherever I'd be here to tell you to do that. No problem at that. Yeah. When you play with the table, yeah. Make sure you give it a nice little knock. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Just for safety. Yeah. And then last but not least, feel free to grab touch or whatever you want to drink. Yeah. You know, it's all game. Great, very good. Great. It seems good. Nice. How do you do all the head in there? Yeah. Main lobby. Yeah. Okay, then you close it a little bit. Yeah. Let me get this truck just a tiny bit more. Yeah. Is that good? I'm sorry, go check. Quick. All right. I don't need any hand control. Okay. You have your own hand. Okay. So behind you, there's a door. There isn't a chair. Window. Window. Window. Booksharp. Yeah. That's the sound of the birth. Leave your name, phone number, and shoe size. Doohy Magnor. 18773 size 10 shoe. Okay, I took remember. You do need to call that one to the one I wanted to. You can't wait to know all about it during Christmas. Leave your name, phone number, and you remember your name. Okay, cash. And the one that you hear I'll love. Thanks. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink or might be. Take a minute. I'll be... Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my white page. But just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up before heading out. So, what are we thinking for dinner? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese sounds good. Chinese food. Hold your host, but I got a warning. It's basically in buys extra authentic, because they don't hold back on spice, so hope you boil your fire extinguisher. Yeah, all good. Spice here the better. That sounds awesome. I love a good spicy meal. It always adds that extra kick to the night. Definitely, yeah. Nothing like a little heat to spice things up. I can already taste those flavours dancing on my tongue. Yeah, very good. Looking forward to it. Absolutely. I can't wait to dig into some delicious food and enjoy the evening with everyone. It's going to be a blast. Very good looking forward to it. It's going to be such a fun night. Good friends and great food make for the best memories. Yeah, food always brings people together. Food really does have a way of connecting us, doesn't it? I love how sharing a meal can create those unforgettable moments with friends. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, frontmariya cat. So, there I am this morning, a little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be a little gumba. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make it good impression. And I'm too gutgump scared of little gumba to us with our actions. So, I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. And I see excessive sweet in these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So, I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So, I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling from me back in office. So, I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So, of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it. And I'm loading off of the documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. Screen on the photo panel. It's low-ing. So, I fill it with ink. I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. But it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding, or is it so? And notes she goes, pull the lens of the glare and the access to this. So, I was horrible to think like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out its ass-ending alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the sort of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to not mess up and make him impress me for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door, and I really don't want to forget it. What do you think? Is there any possible university where she wears this for the day? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do you think? Is there any possible university where she wears this for the day? Yeah, looks good. Looks modern. Might be a bit too small. Thanks. I just want to make sure I look decent for tonight. It feels like such a big deal, you know. I guess I could always go for a different look if that's a favorite. Just trying to make a good impression, you know. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gate at the hide. And she's just really cool. I'm going to look at her. She's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between broke shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So I'll tell you about what happened on the first day. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's an age? In Aedron. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how criticised I extort my name, and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in age raised. And then... Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke. And just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... ...Gee, Nockie or something equally ignorant. And the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...start laughing. And so I'm figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is it wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just talks. Talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is a whole fucking girl. And the rest of the day just... ...passes the passion. I tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So why not at least to go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole deenocchi gate... ...someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And... ...I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me. And agrees just as Violet walks by kin and... ...I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. ...to the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had too much to get out of it. So... ...shall I cut myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such a short notice. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on my path. What you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked... ...maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... ...I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean... ...tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What I actually mean to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you tell them... ...to step and do something different. Come on. We'll try again. What do you say? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing? Come here. Make yourselves at home. Just put your hands on it. Check the other room. Just keep going, Don't be olhaing. I guess we might be a bit complicated like many people. One more thing... Sorry about that. I really wanted it toŸÑŸÉ. Well, but by that moment I am pretty umtsing theil of our stud. He went to the game with him, got crushed. Violet sends him up, she's on their mind so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, we're a close other. We're just joking about stuff and then Violet came part in, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like, ships in a night. The music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, everything's great. Really, it is Ari, he's amazing. It's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea, I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late to this moment and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create some of my physical parts. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know about whatever. Like, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for myself. See what was around in my face. So, rather than a Swiss paper, you can pin them on that more than. I like it for too much. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know whether I need a paper. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at Aurel, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-thousand memory was. A new Aurel, amongst me being with my sister, maybe. There she is. I'm a picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' part. Not places like. Well, you're sorry, say good things in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. Become other people. Live other lives. We were the kids. So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found me again pretty quickly. But, it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Caron fighting completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't he? Just to set. I'll go see you too, then maybe you can meet him. He's into you from there. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, give me a break. I missed two days. My life is shared custody. But how do I get to see him as is? No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him to a quality time with my son, it's not as we're doing. What do you mean? It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand by that. I'm actually a large maker decision, but I'm wondering how we still have fucking detailed value. Juditations are key to see the world greatest. By that, that's not fair. No. No, look by that. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I hope people are right, but so... No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's time. Speak. Fitch! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about it? Yeah, just a bit of us. Good. I'd hope you to hear me lose a fight. I've probably already lost a hundred times before. Things are just... You know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just went to see you like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took the origin of John? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some downtime. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. He explored the city. And he had Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more, and to the mat, I had quartz-like tickets at the nap again. Loved it. The stream first was awesome, though. I was a little bit late, but it was him dragging me out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship, I'd be left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks upon fondly, not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time, I think that's all that we are. Don't worry. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think it's important to hold on to those moments that shape us. Growing up with my family, I always hope I'd never forget. Cherishing family. It's like a melody that stays with you, isn't it? Those memories? They're the notes that create our song. I want to know what you think about this, indeed. OK, so you know, Violet and I, we've been through a lot. I mean, check us today. It's like trying to write a duet. I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in York. Please, no, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's Safer there. Oh, well, I don't know. Well... She's gone. Trying to decision, probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're in idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. They. No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't meddle. Please don't, I told you. Stand apart you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Yeah. They could be in the bookshelf. I'll check here. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. I'm going to check on the alert piano. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Yeah, I can't find them. Or the platform. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. It's okay. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them all the time in my pocket. Sorry. I've been writing my memoirs. It's difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forums we used to play in? No. That was scary. I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. I started to worry that you would have actually said me out. When it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. We didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are at Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you hold a meter, shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation sidelined into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. Only other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So now, remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This wasn't her first date, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then you're in it. Please, just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a big cup of full, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. That would cost a few here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your arm. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This, Strongens, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll in slick, but the scenes don't hold calling Genokey like it's played at gold and proskato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you, your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace, you're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat, you twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral sheep, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch, hope. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one mis-reply, and you're on dish-duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your vet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sin, you play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed, now look at you, all hat no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of County Port, I've seen a war walk out the door, I set the table, tuned the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save you, no, say, then I can count, from broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and to stare, you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the St. Traste of Array, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kendelmen, Jaram Belvitt in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mama Mia in your plight. Allora strums by a fancule, I am not a mend, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay, bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, or we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step, only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He's has more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. I would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meafos. He's a great fan now. He tests this big man, all those oranges, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Politrate, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Mad o nama. Ah, get figged out. Oh, he's the sparking up velvet storm. Snapping in time with the twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked to lie. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And walked outside. And the red and yellow suns had covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life.\n",

      " Of course. A couple of things. When you start, I'll be inside with you. Okay. You should see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Okay. Once that, I can get out just to want to confirm that you're in the correct space. Yeah, yeah, sure. You will have sometimes a red line or a green line on top of you. When you see green, it means you're allowed to talk. When it's red, you means you're not allowed to talk. Okay. Okay. And always try to wait for him to finish talking before you speak. At some point, you're going to move from this room to that room. If it's not clear when, then what about it? I'll be watching. I can say you want to move. Okay. And then, there's a memory you're going to do something in this table. Okay. Make sure that you hit it. You know, don't try to tap it. Hit it. Hit it. Okay. And then, last but not least, is speak in our normal voice. Okay. Okay. Yes. And then, the only thing is we reward people that are searching for things. Okay. Let me just turn this off before I think of it. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, let's get. Perfect. All right. No, no, no, no. Perfect. All right. Here we go. Okay. So, do you see your door? Yes. Do you see your window? Yes. And you see a motion. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Good. Thank you. things a bond is full of Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what do you want to eat? Are you in the mood for French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? I go for French. French, huh? Alright, fair warning. Last time the portions were so tiny I almost ordered a second in that. Oh it's okay I'm willing to give a chance. I know it's a bit pricey but I've heard great things about that new bistro downtown and I've been dying to try it out. Plus I have some news to share with you and the others but let's get everyone together first. Okay let's do it. Awesome I was thinking we could grab the gang and meet up there at seven. Does that sound good to you? Oh and by the way have you listened to that new album from Bon Jovi yet? I have it's fantastic. Really enjoying it. Me too man. I was thinking we could even convince the others to hit up that concert they're having at the stadium next month. Would be so sick. Let's do it. Man is good to see you A. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job sorry in terms of the publishing house. Well the head of my department she's called Sarah and no exaggeration the woman is certifiably insane. I mean she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her but either way whenever she spots me she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure you know and a kind of boundary with these intensely manicured eyebrows like what's it called? Little gumber. You know front Maria got so there I am this morning and little gumber summons me to her office and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed and how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at the 40 different documents she's holding and then it dorms on me but gumber is sending me to the copier room and I know it doesn't sound like much with this fucking machine man I swear Sarah might be little gumber but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest it's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze but I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression and I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to ask for directions so I just start running from room to room pretending that I know where I'm going but for the longest time the whole place looks exactly the same I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor it's the executive suite and these two slip Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeball in me and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set but in the ivory fucking tower so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal but I know the copier room is in the basement so I get out of that I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself find the path find the path like I'm Indiana Jones by this point you know at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in office so I'm freaking out and I run down into the right room in the basement and the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing I'm all lost in the supermarket so of course I take that as some kind of sign from God but I'm fundamentally doomed but then somehow I I actually find it and I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials and I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturm I am lost I'm going to make it but then I press copy and an alarm goes off the screen on the front panel says low ink so I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over and that is like I've killed it it makes this hideous grinding noise inside and notes she goes full into blur in the access to this so I was hobbit and ink like everywhere on the walls on the floors on the fucking ceiling and it's fire in paper out it's our send an alarm sounding the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine coveted in looking like our text in the swan to sadness and little goombas there with them she doesn't say anything she just stands there smiling at me smiling like she's thinking see I knew an asshole that was it they fired me on this time it's just a job but you know I really wanted out of there just to knock myself and make an impression if once hey can you see my jacket out there I could have sworn I left it by the door um what do you think is that any possible universe in which issue where this for the day I like it I think it works on you yeah that's still it and you're it this is so fresh I'm starving let's get going I have some awesome news to share with the guys later you have to understand it's important that I get this right tell me have you ever had a really bad first day my first date with this girl was a total disaster that's why I'm going for this something neutral hopefully I'll actually look normal this time her name is byler and I met her one the gate egg plate and she's just really cool she's stirring to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like a cross between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just really smart so they tell you about what happened on the first date card I was so late Lord knows how long she been waiting man I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted so I missed the bus and ended up going to run there and it started raining on the way like thundering down so by the time I finally stagger into the restaurant I look like I don't know a cat that had just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking obviously so I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything she's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's an age in in Rocky as nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is it makes me have in compensate even more so I'm just blowering at her I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest I can't even remember what I was saying I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath let alone allow her to get her word in age raised and then oh Jesus let us sort of realise that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just oh god it just died on me and later when I'm ordering it's this Italian place I say something done asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron and she just starts laughing and so I figuring that's it I'm dead I'm done and I'm screwing myself in my head you asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction why is wrong with you but probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally gets violently opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell it was time to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so violently used to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home and the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky gate summons over the major day and violets about to come back any second now I'm convinced this guy has it against me so I've gotten no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering thank you to the major D and so somehow I had to get out of it so surely I got messed up twice in a row can I she's really special thanks for coming at such short notice I just I've got this this thing it's for violet she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write or something something that expresses what church remains to me and I just I can't get it on the path what you do when when you're mentally blocked maybe I just show you what I've got I have this melody but I don't know I don't know what it's going I mean I like it but where is this leading sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says I mean tell me how to do it you know tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I'm just maybe I'm just not good at this maybe that's it this is the universe tell them you to just stay up and do something different and just ah let me try again what do you think maybe this come on come play with me come on don't be scared that's it that's it keep going keep going that's the path with nine and Come here. I'll meet you at home. I'll just put you on your bed. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. I'll meet you at home. Oh! The mustard is away. The mustard is away. I'll go and see you at home. Maybe you can meet him if he's in a group. Hi! Hi, there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as his. No, no. He misses a couple of days off school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second. Yeah. No, don't understand Violet. I'm actually a labs maker decision without wanting every single fucking detail about you. Two days of kill to see the world of the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Bitch! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about it? Oh, sorry. We heard... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We heard a bit. Just a little bit. All right. Is every night... You heard me. But before you judge, remember, I'm better right in limits than having tough conversation. I was thinking about our plans. Are we still going to meet the others to eat out today? You know? Messing. You know, I'm trying to... So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.A. that often. You know, especially with Tori and all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. I'm just wondering if I could just... Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took origin to York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. He never came at once. There were some small shows. Small acoustic swats for the big bands. I like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. And get Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat. I caught sight tickets at the nap. I loved it. The streamfermist does awesome. And he stayed up late. But he was human drugging the arbeid in the morning. And do more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship. I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. You know speaking of memories, what's the one thing that comes to mind that you'll never want to forget? Waking up with my children in bed in the Saturday morning. That sounds wonderful. There's something special about those quiet mornings with loved ones, isn't there? There is. It's the everyday little moments that we remember. Not the big events. The best part of being a parent, isn't it? Those are the things that stay with us long after everything else fades away. It's the moments in between. Exactly. The in-between moments. They're the ones that feel most real, don't they? Well, they're the bits that nobody else sees. It's just you, your family. My friend. I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in New York. Please. No, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course, she knew I was always lost from the very start. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course, I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there, with it. Of course, it will. If you look... What do they think? They think... Of course, they know. Idiot. You believe they're an idiot. You never let them see. They... They... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He's not here. He's not here. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshop. Or in the cabinet. Found them there. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry. I've become so forgetful. Thank you. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. How good is me? I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. They always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest who used to play in? That was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh, yeah. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. And I was a complete stranger. It would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're whole demeanor. And it was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. How it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, oh my god, you're such a bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't braven of myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for him late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear. Are you a lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here, and then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is... Tell how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave the bracelet, then well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Labanet. Labanet. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior, yes, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This, Strongens, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depth, you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe. Give it a week, I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming. But near the end, one wrong move, one misprocline. You're on dish duty, no ale by the music swells. The moment's so much, but the moment's so much, but the moment's so much, but the ale by the music swells. The moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked, you're sim, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move, you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace, you pranced in light. Forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake. She hits your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. But you can't trick the Kendelman jar, I'm velvet. In a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mamma Mia in your plight. A Laura strones by a fancule, I am not a man. I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Sure as what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid down in line, left or right, but we start here. The salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These have more locked up than a mob account and witness protection. I would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo's. He's a great friend now. He tests this big man, all that answers, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the rather. Slide. Slide. Paolo tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Ma, oh, na, ma, gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. He's not been in time with the twist repo. Eyes on fire. Oh, is that? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. The no-rad and yellow sunsett covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's his father. Oh, okay. Thanks. There you go.\n",

      " Yes, as I always say, in a perfect place you actually wouldn't come in like this, there will actually be a door, you'll be prepping the attendants and you will come in this way, but in this case, yeah. That's all right. A couple of things to tell you. When we start the experience, I'll be inside with you. I just want to make sure that you see a door, a window, a window in a bookshelf. Once with that's it, I'll get out of your way. Number two, you're going to see a red or a green thing on the top of your visor. When it's red it means you can't talk, when it's green it means you can't talk. You should've said let him finish before you talk, but sometimes there's a little bit of a bug. Another thing is, at some point you're going to be asked to move from this room to the next room, until that happens, don't go anywhere else. If it doesn't become apparent, don't worry, I'm here to make sure that I tell you go to the next room. And last but not least is, we reward people that explore it, so you are allowed to touch, smell, eat, drink, whatever you find. Oh, okay, cheers. Very good. All right, so I'll pat this on. Yeah, let's go. Just turn it up. Yeah, it looks good. Okay, looks good. Looks like it's a place. You should be in the main logging in. Yeah. Yeah, hand tracking scores, let's go. What's this built in? Oh, real? Nice, yeah. So you should see behind you a door? Oh, yes, very good. Yeah, and then on the left, the window. Great, yeah. Yeah, very good. Yeah, and a sink and everything. Great. Enjoy. Thank you. Okay, let's try this. Cool. Thanks, we know it's not. Now, you can always touch it. Yeah. You know the rules, right? I'm going to try it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Burgers. Whoa. Yeah, Burgers are good. That's true. Sometimes you can't go wrong with the classics, especially when you're in the mood for something hearty and satisfying. Yep, true indeed. Okay. Yeah. It's all... Burgers are definitely a solid choice. I'm all for savoring the simple pleasures in life. And a good meal with friends is what it's all about. Okay. Can I look this through? Nope. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Interimship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. I don't even know exactly where she is. The woman is certifiable. Thank you. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cup, these are the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gulp-gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit are eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. Am I lost in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the excess distance. So I was harming it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me. Standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I can't seem to find it. And I have a feeling it might be outside. I can see it. Mm-hmm. I wonder. I wonder if this machine record about an hour's worth of MTV. I wonder. This might be an interest on experiment. What are you asking for? I wonder. And more important. I wonder if it's a universe in which it's right. This is the whole thing. Sure. Why not? You never know when I pop back on the phone and say something clever that might need to be committed to permanent archives. Cool, cool. I'll just... Oh, I get it. I'm saying this story don't pull out the neon one. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was... A total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... ...neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the gate I played. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like... ...across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really dare anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like a... ...what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in age raised. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... ...oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...jean-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes viral at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...percreative intent when she's designing and... ...the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell-bound. Thinking, my god, this skill is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...tell it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. While it leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, someone's over the matri-day. And while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. I must have looked so pathetic that the matri-day takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. So the matri-day. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you're to stop and do something different. Maybe I just... Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm a little bit scared. I'm a little bit scared. I'm not scared. Keep going. I'm not scared. Keep going. I'm not scared. Don't worry. I'm not scared. Keep going. Keep going. I'm not scared. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. What are you doing over there? Come here. Okay, thank you. I'm just putting all of you to bed. I'm just putting all of you to bed. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Hey. Sorry about that. Hi. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But, Violet cried. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know worse, host, other. We're just joking a bit. Violet came part of her and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take her away. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to...well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up legs this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of being here. I wanted to create something physical for me. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know? See, it was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I know. I love it. No problem at all. You really know why the earth is here. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Henri, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things like the God. It made me realize what a temple thing that I'm like it. He with Henri, he runs there being with my sister living. There she is. She's a pigeon. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parent's job. And that place was like, well, you're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. Live other lives. We were kids, right? So we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. But she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried it completely. The easiest is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etching and just stirring so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the wake is in. Just a sec. I go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him. He isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddies. Buddy's here. Buddy's here. Oh, give me a break. You missed two days. It's not a big... Violet, I hope it's shared custody. But I want to get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple of days off school, because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the week. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he'd been. Jeez, listen to yourself for a second, will ya? Don't you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision, but I'm wondering how we still go for fucking detail, Violet. Two days of kill to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going on to pick this later. I have people arriving, so... No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's the time. Speak. Fiddish. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... How much did you hear about that? Not much. Great. Let's keep it that way. The world hears enough of my mistakes already, without adding parenting fails into the game. Things are just, you know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either of them. You know, especially with toy and all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventional, but Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took it out to you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute, and it figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. Erwin's small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And kept re-in food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more, and to the mat, I've caught sight tickets at the nap, to the end. Love that. The stream films does also serve. We stayed up late to show, but it was him dragging me out of bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more, and see more. Another new I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left, but I want to owe it to him what he used to mean. I want him to have memory that he looks on the moment. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. I'm right. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? I think for me it's those little moments. At shape who we are. I agree. I agree. Yeah. Wow. Okay, you've dropped that. I mean, did you at least hear the part I made a good point? No? Yeah, I do. There's something special about Captain Howard. Whose fleeting memories isn't there. It's like they become a part of our stop. Please. No, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Did I? Did I really? I couldn't have. Yes, of course I'm sure. I'm not brave enough for that. It'll be there with it. Of course it will. If you look. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. Oh my God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Sure. They could have been the bookshelf. Of course. Or in the cabinet. I found them there before. All the drawers. Come on, that's what you're supposed to do. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I'm going to shut there to be a room. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Oh goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. That was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh yeah. God, this is own embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... Yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. And then I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. And when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was a possibly cool young guy. So yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a honest... It was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know I didn't know immediately how to respond. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you hold a meter, shift it. It was like he came behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such an openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unhappy to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I've gotten your sister, really. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. Yeah, how it destroyed you. And I was just... Thumb struck a Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what we've been saying. That I wasn't really... I don't know, wasn't really being attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely unconsequential stuff and you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but my dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear... What about your lady friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first day and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think I'm a fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know? I'm not a fool. She said she wanted it. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle it. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. What are you doing, Wade? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, now I'm just going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I'd have to start. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? La Bain√©. La Bain√©. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior, yes, and you're. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Call him Genokey, like it's played at gold. And Prosecato pizza lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depth. You can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're sinned. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, Goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of County Port. I've seen a morgue out the door. I set the table to the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the nights. I save punoctay that I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And this dare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trash to array. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the Kendelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mia. In your plight. Allora strones. By a fan cool. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. Or we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't know. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we'd better hear. Yeah, like me and me both. It's crap, went in there. Fast bend. Although, one sees only an output in Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Pala tricks on. Your family must be thrilled. Yeah. Yeah, like me and me both. It's crap went in there. Fast bend. You know, it must be thrilled. Yeah, it's not to rewind the microwave last week. You know this anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Mad o'onam. Ah, gifigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, do I? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. The red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flare. The base drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's as far as you can. Alright, cool. I think the song...\n",

      " Usually we say let him finish before you talk You will start in this room at some point you move to that room. Mm-hmm. Once you're in that room you stay in that room. Yeah It should be Understandable by the story but if you listen to more about it, I'll let you know that When you speak speak at this level. Yeah, yeah exactly or the one side. That's not enough Yeah At some point you're gonna use this table make sure that you hit nicely rather than And Lasting is feel free to play with whatever you see touch investigate. All right That I was I You Yeah, there you go Yeah Pretty I'm gonna take it to show up. Thank you. Thank you. You guys are good, real good. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Just a few seconds. Just a few seconds. I'm sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up before we headed out but since we're eating out anyway, it doesn't matter. Hey, what do you feel like eating? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Chinese maybe? Yeah, better. Chinese maybe? I was thinking we could hit up that new Sichuan place downtown. I've been hearing great things about it and we can grab the others there. Singtile, right? Had it a few times. It's actually pretty good. We can definitely get a few of those to go with dinner. All right. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job sorry in turnship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her, but either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows, like what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front Maria got. So there I am this morning and little gumber summons me to her office and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed and how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding and then it dorms on me, but the gumber is sending me to the copy room. I know it doesn't sound like much, with this fucking machine, man, I swear Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding these things like an authoritarian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places of total ways, but I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression and I'm too got scared of little gumber to us with our retchins. So I just start running from room to room, standing that I know where I'm going, but for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip Charlie Sheen types in suit to eyeball and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything is normal, but I know the copy room is in the basement, so I get out of there, I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path, like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, with the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit is coming in from all sides and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office, so I'm freaking out and I run down into the right room in the basement and the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturmord singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket, so of course I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed, but then somehow I actually find it and I'm loading up other documents and lining the number down and I'm thinking scream you Joe Sturmord, I am lost, I'm gonna make it and then I press copy and an alarm goes off, scream on the front panel so it's annoying. So I fill it with ink, I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over and then it's like I've killed it, it makes this hideous grinding noise inside and notes she goes full in the glare in the excess distance, I was hobbitin' ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors and the fucking ceiling and it's fire in paper, it's our sendin', the lava and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covered it in looking like RTX in the swanter sadness and little goon was there with them, she doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, I know I asked hold, that was it, they fired me on this part, I mean it's just a job but you know, I really wanted out of there, just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Hey can you see my jacket out there? Yeah. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which is she wear this for the day? Yeah, I think so. Looks cool. I knew it. I just got it yesterday, thought it would be perfect for tonight. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster, that's why I'm going for this, something unusual. Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Viola and I met her one day, she's just really cool. She's stunning and beautiful, like across between Brook Shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So I'll tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up having to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like what's her name? Adrian, in Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in edge rays and then... Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... It's just hot laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... ...past in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late, so... ...buy at least to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, someone's over the maturday. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the motor detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering to the maturday. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually needs to. And I just can't get it on the path. What you do when you're mentally blocked. Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What does it actually mean to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to stop and do something different. I'm just... I'm just trying to go. What do you think? Maybe this. Come on. Come play with me. I'm not gonna look this guy. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. What are you doing over there? I'm just putting on each guy. Yeah, I can go. Yeah. Yeah. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Yeah. I'm doing it. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted it to meet you all. But by the night of the completely militant last week, I went and get with it. I got crushed. By the sends of my cheese on the line, so she'll be up for joy. I know, I know, we're so sorry about that. We're just joking about stuff. And by the pain part, and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I went, like, ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes, you know, I'm long enough to type the other person in to take care of Rory. Anyway, everything's great. Because it is. Rory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. Thanks, Mark. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, see you in the favour. I always burst those coming up letters from. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps it from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's pretty much about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it's a very cool thing when he's older. You know, see what's around him and he's very cool. So, rather than a slipper paper, you can pin them on that one of that. Like, you've written this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are and they're things from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at all, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was already in my sister's room. There she is. She's not picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind a family home. This was the former parent's style. And that place was like, well, we saw it sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we leave the aching and lonely behind. And come up with people. Live other lives. Because we're the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We've been met whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. We never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found me again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carflighting, I think. Just help you lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etching stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just a sat. I'm going to see to them. Maybe for me. Is it too broken? Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Sorry, I don't think the same scratch. We know that that happens sometimes. You can just say that. Yes. All right. Okay, you just started again from the you from the Unreal Engine. Right. TX. Yeah. Yeah. Are you didn't quite do it? No. We're going to have to do it the horrible way. Okay, close that. Restart the whole thing. All right. There you go. Yeah, I know some of those are happens. Yeah. We will learn is there enough not enough light? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was in that part, I think like when the particles appears, it seems a little bit laggy. It seems too much particles. Yeah. You finished the forest basically. Yes. And yes. Yeah. Which I figure exactly what is it that doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes it runs through completely and sometimes it crashes. So we don't know exactly what is it that what is the the thing that's making crash. We think we do we think it's a tree. Yeah. Just too many trees. Yeah. I think it's between trees and leaves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, usually also walking on some trees in X-ray tea and then so expensive to remember. Yeah. All the time. Yeah. You should be in the lobby. Yes. Okay. So when it goes dark. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See that. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple days of smoke that we're going to take them on to and spend some mobility time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. I'm actually a large making decision but I'm wondering if we still have fucking detail by you. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about all of them? I know, I know it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it but I'm just messy. You know, messy. I'm trying to be a good father to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.E. that often. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally but I let you just feel like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin of York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute but I figured what the hell I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US because all his Christmases came at once. I knew it was down climb and we spent all that time together. Me and Head. We explored the city and kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat. I caught sight tickets at the nap today. I loved it. The streamfamous does also. I was in the morning and I was feeling late. It was him dragging the bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. I wanted to have memories that it looked unfunny. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After time I think that's all that we are. But seriously, what's the one thing that you'll never want to forget my friend? Yeah, probably the first one. The first one, I have one of those two. My son's birth, or it's a memory that I'll always treasure. Yeah, it's a lot of treasure. I'm thinking of taking him to New York soon. Anyway, we should get going, right? Everyone's waiting for us to grab some lunch. All right, let's go. Hold on, just a minute. Something's been on my mind. Wanted to share it with you before we go. I'm here. Got some news about my job in putting it off, but yeah, it's a big change. I'll tell you about the climate of our eight in New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Thank you. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They think. Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Hmm. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. Oh, look, this same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, uncertain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't know who they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. And so sorry I've become so forgetful. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. That was just difficult because I'm losing everything and things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me bush-nose. The warnings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. God, this is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you worked there. And I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. And I was like, what are you doing? When it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it and felt almost intimate. Like you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck and Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and... Yeah, I had to completely inconsequential stuff and you just... Listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child. Like getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robert? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really dating and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's that you're hearing? It's true. And my day is going to come back here and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I saw the guy come back tomorrow and settle up. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. And this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is... how are you going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're being a copter-fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That's a copter-fool here. Seriously, if I pivot to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me. So, why did you go up to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, you just lost that dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. But bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong is what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold calling Geno Key. Like it's played at gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I need you. I'm going to play this game. I'm going to play this game. And now, how come you're going to play that game? Hey it's playin' gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Ko-lin clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash a smile. Tripp on Grace. You're tryin' to leave. But lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. Now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaps, you're sim, you play it slick. But here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it, post and watch you try, you'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, two in the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save you, no, take, and I can count, from broken lines to prosek on nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and this dare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your knee, you're the same trash to the ray, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the candelman, jar, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mamma Mia, in your plight. Allura strums, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, sure as what you got. OK, no pressure, Chris, no pressure. Bye. OK. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, but we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point, don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow. I need slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? This has more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. I will better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo's. He's a great fan now. He tests this big man, all those oranges, practically knock off Nebraska, real under the rather. Slide, slide. You're a parlor trick, son. Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Mad o'onama, gaffigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with the twist, repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Freak. I remember everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to ride out of here. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow suns had covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. Mm-hmm. The land on the flares, the base drops low. Time took a pause.

      " So, originally you would actually be out of the sound and it would be a door. You can't have an headset through inside, but obviously because of the infrastructure like this. When you're inside the headset, I will be here at the beginning. And we're gonna make sure that there's a door right there, a window right there, no bookshelf right there. Okay, all right, that's all for you there. That's fine, I can do it. You will see a green and red stripe on top of you. Yeah, every now and then. Green means that you can talk, or red means that you can't. Okay, usually we say that end finish and then you'll see that make a stop. You should be in this room most of the time and then at some moment you have moved to the other room which it doesn't make sense when, don't worry about it, I'll let you know. Okay, and then last but not least is, we reward people with that, or playing around with things. So, wherever everything touch, you do whatever you want, see, don't, it's up to you. Yeah, open it up. There you go, should I take the glasses? Oh yeah, for example. There you go. You should be in the lobby. Yeah, it says lobby main. Perfect. Yeah. Time. There's a total of 50. So, you did before? Yeah. And then when there areiam Se mathematician at a cancer risk? Yeah. Thank you. f f f h o Mr S yes, watching last year right now that was a cup of nakalori Bitch, that's not laughing. Just do seconds. Help me. I'm on fire. Help me last year on fire. I could help you. I'll just do the dog. Luffy, you like the brother I never had. Hey, sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up. So it doesn't. So what you do? We could do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. Ooh, something different. Unintrieves, I'm always done to try something new. Lead the way. Hello? Whoa, I was expecting you to be running a bit late, but you're right on time. I was literally getting ready to head out the door. How's it going? Good. Glad to hear that. I've got some news to share. I'm going to get a little bit of a deal. I've got some news to share with you, but let's wait till we're walking. I want to tell everyone at the same time. OK. It's not a big deal or anything. Just something I found out yesterday about my job. We can catch up on the way to the restaurant. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip a cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set but in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God and fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no, I mean. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes the hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the excess distance. I was hobbitin' ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was at our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like RTX in the swan to sadness. And little goombas there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, an asshole. That was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted out of there. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? You know, if you're not saying anything, that probably mean that looked too good, and your chance of my staff. I can't see you. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Yeah, I feel state with this girl was, a terrible person. Yeah, I feel state with this girl was, a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Can you move closer? Her name's Violet, and I met her one day gay tech-light, and she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, beautiful, like a cross between brought shields, and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. Card, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus, and ended up running to run there, and it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal, and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? I think I've been talking about my music, and how precise that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more, so I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get in word, and edge raised, and then... Oh, Jesus! Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's just Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, jee-knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring, that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up, and just... spellbound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knock-igate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possession I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks back in, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering, thank you, to the major day. And so, somehow, I had too much to get out of it. So, surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What do you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... Ha! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... maybe I'm just not good at this? Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. I mean, just... Ha! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. It's very nice. Completely. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. What are you doing over there? Come here. Yeah. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting your all into bed. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all. But Violet and I have become pretty militant of our sleep training. And going to the game where we've got crush. Violet sends a mug. She's on deadline. So, I'm just going to go back to the game. I'm just going to go back to the game where we've got crush. Violet sends a mug. She's on deadline. So, she won't be able to join us. And I know, I know, worse, her, or the other. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like, ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. Sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ori, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always birthed those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Ori. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are doing for him. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ori. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple is saying in memory yet. He, with Ori, was one of the things with my sister, Midi. There she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parent's job. And that place was like, well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. We went to this place because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. It's just the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. And what it means to actually lose something but that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't he? Just a sat. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, give me a break. Missed two days. It's not a big... My life is shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of it. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been... Jesus, listen to yourself, Chris. Now you don't understand by that. I'm actually a loud smaker decision without money. I've been seeing you before. You're making it. By the last not fair. No, look. No, look by that. By the... Listen to me. Look out. I don't know why. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Oh. Okay. Oh. Sorry. Who you guys coming? How much did you hear about? Nothing. All of it. Okay. So you know, Violet and I... You know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. Especially when you're touring on the path. I'm approaching it a little on convention. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took over to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute. I figured what the hell I'll take him with me. Never been to New York. All of his Christmas, it came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands. I like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And had green food for the time. I took him to sleep no more and... until the maps are caught, so I take it to the nap thing. I loved it. This dream film is just awesome. And we stayed up late for the show. It was him dragging me out of bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love when you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to make. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. That's quite a statement, everything. But if I had to ask you, what's the one thing that you never want to forget? Something that will stay with you no matter what life brings. My kids being poor. Those are definitely moments you want to hold on to. The memories of their first cries. I'm actually planning a trip to New York with Oresou. Just the two of us can't wait to see the look on his face when he sees the city for the first time. New York. Yeah. New York. Yeah. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Oh. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They. No don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. I told you. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch so they're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just I don't know where. Could you... would you help me find them? Okay. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. All the drawers. Or so far. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there but or the piano. Or the plant. Oh, I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did it. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Yeah, you told me that one. Oh, I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Bylet the other day. It's the darkness thing. I... God, if this is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. Oh, when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it meant you at your gig you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then so I couldn't just ring you to tag. Then finally this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, wait into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away and how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris, because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I now remember thinking, my god, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and the other completely and consequential stuff. And you just listen, like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wouldn't have anything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I got I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of a fool. Please. But you are a fool. Geno. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is coming back here and then he minutes. So please just got me some slack. I saw it going. I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. We have the policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one and this bracelet. It was it was my grandmother's and it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet. To get you out this. Pabish? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This throne, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep but the scenes don't hold calling Gino Key like it's played at gold and prosketo pizza lands with flair.

      " Say one two. One two. One two. Alright, there you go. Cool. So yes, we're going to go through to the two of us. That's right. Yeah. How's it going? Good. Good. Right. So, originally you would actually be outside and there would be a door and you would come in the headset through inside but obviously because of the infrastructure. Yeah, I guess. When you're inside the headset, we'll be here at the beginning. Okay. And we're going to make sure that there's a door right there, a window right there, and a bookshelf right there. Okay. Alright, if that's all three there, then that's fine. I can go away. You will see a green and a red stripe on top of you. Yeah, every now and then. Green means that you can talk. Okay. It means that you can't. Okay. Usually we say that him finished and then you'll see that you can able to talk. Okay. You should be in this room most of the time and then at some moment you can move to the other room. If he doesn't make a sense when, don't worry about it. I will let you know. Okay. And then last but not least is we reward people that are playing around with things. So grab everything, touch, eat, do whatever you want. You know, it's up to you. Yeah. I'll open it a little more. There you go. That should fit with glasses. Oh yeah. Straight contour. There you go. You should be in the lobby. Yeah, it just says lobby main. Perfect. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So behind you you should see the door. Yeah. And then the window. There. Yeah. And then the bookshelf. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. Enjoy. Thank you. Okay. Excuse me. I actually don't need contact, let me show you. You have our brand. You can see the c. stands. Ys. You. Okay and then there. Just two seconds. So it doesn't get... We can do French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers. Oh, something different. I'm a treat. I always dance to try something new. Be the way. Hello? Whoa, I was expecting you to be running a bit late, but you're right on time. I was literally getting ready to head out the door. How's it going? Good. Glad to hear that. I've got some news to share with you. But let's wait till we're walking. I want to tell everyone at the same time. Okay. It's not a big deal or anything. Just something I found out yesterday about my job. We can catch up on the way to the restaurant. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's as a one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, for a moringa. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the... ...copy of real. I mean, I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding these things like an offering quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gone-gun scared of little gumber to us with our retchies. So I just stop running from room to room, I'm telling you that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, a whole place that's exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. I'm suddenly realised I'm on the top floor. It's the excessive suite, and there's two slip-challenge shin times and two to eyeball. And I know I'm not supposed to ever reset, but I would fucking tell her. So I just keep my head down, and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is on the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, we start the film when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a while to run. I start thinking that could be a little gumber yelling through the back of the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room of the basement. The du-box is playing Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamental doomed. But then, somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents, lining the number down, and thinking, Scream, you Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, then I'm gonna dress copy, and then I'll arm goes off. Scream, the front panel says, low. So, I fill it with ink, I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy, but I know, I know, I know, that it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding, or something. And then she goes probably in the Blair in the Existence, and so I was parmined in ink, like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was ascending, a large sounding. And the staff are worse than from the officers to see what's happening, and it's just me. Standing alongside this screaming machine, covered it in, looking like artics in the saltous sadness. And little Goombas then, she doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling. Just smiling like she's thinking. So, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this spot, I mean, it's just the job, but, you know, I really wanted, I learned. Just, to knock myself and make an impression of you once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I can't let it all catch you. What do you think? Is that any possible university in which I should wear this for the day? You know, if you're not saying anything, that's probably the end of the two-bird and your dance of my style. I can't see you. You have to understand, it's important I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? Yeah. The first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'm actually looking normal this time. Can you move closer? God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jam myself until a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow not just spewed out my entire life story, but I'm stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hear it to get a word in a dress and then... Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought that I tried to line her mood by telling a joke and just, oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the wind is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring, that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first young shouldn't. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it's fine because I let the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and creative intent when she's designing and... the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up and just... ...spelbound thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just has to in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I reglit so while at least to go to the bathroom, I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky guy summons over the matredate. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of it. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of god, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matredate takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in and I'm still my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the matredate and so somehow I had to mostly get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Hey, so coming at such short notice, I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write this something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just can't get it on my path. What you do when you're mentally blocked, maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, what my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife, what actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to just stay up and do something different. Come on! Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. It's very nice. Come on, look this guy. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path! Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What are you doing over there? Come here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey. I'm sorry, Papa. I really wanted it to me more. But by the night when I was pretty well, it was a fast-leaf journey. You had to get rid of your crush. By the scent of love, she's on the verge of buying something. She's lucky on the trail. I know, I know, we're just very sound up. We're just joking about stuff in love. By the way, she came part of it. She's under a lot of pressure. She and I were... like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... sometimes we get up long enough to tag the other person in, to take care of our... anyway... Look. Everything's great. Because it is already... he's amazing. So, that's the day of my life. And... he's mine. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... well... speak with me. I always burst into your words, and I was thinking about how... people don't really have memories of you first, when you're here with their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. And it keeps safe. From this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Right. You know... what you know now will... what you should know now. I think... It's pretty cool to put a belt on. And then... it seems around you in some ways. So... don't have a password, just put the paper. You can spin the one up more than that. Okay. I think it's going to work. I don't really know what it is. So weird. When I spend time at all, I remember the things from my child. Yeah, things like the dog. It really realized... what a terrible thing you've never yet. You've already... not been being with my sister, but... there she is. Not pitch. She always played this far. Behind a family home. This was before the time. My face was like... Well... there's sort of sacred tears in this weird kind of way. I guess... because it was like hours and... whenever we went there, we believed that... 80-90 behind. The common people... live otherwise. Because... we're the kids, right? So... we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We've been hoping that... we'd just drive into this castle. And... because it just felt so... like this gigantic playground. So... we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day they got lost on that. We had a path that... we always took to get in and out. And she just... was straight, I guess. There's the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean... I think that's a foundry going pretty quickly. But we found like an eternity at the time. And... I was young. We... we have no real set of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something. But that day... I'm trying to completely... just help me to... lose something with that. I guess that's why I want to have something to worry. Something permanent. Edge in stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh! The master is awake, is it? Just a sec. Go see to the new gemia. Give it to you, probably. Hi. I have that little one here. That is here. That is here. That is here. I guess we... Missed two days. A few days. Five, four, three, eight, seven, eight. Probably one. No, no. Maybe the couple didn't know. That's the thing. One time, one time. Not much, yet. What do you mean? Just a minute, just a minute. Just a minute, please. No, no. I'm not sure. I'm sick. I have plenty of things to worry about. I think that you need to be able to see the world awake. But I also... No. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's the time. Just a minute. Fish. Oh. Oh. Sorry. What did you do? I didn't see you. I didn't see you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't see you. I'm sorry. Oliver. Okay. So you know, Violet Knight. He's just... You know. You know, I'm trying to... to be a good father. So make it work that pretty pretty anyway. I don't see all of that often. You know. Especially in a toy all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet is just waiting to see you. Is there ever any bad plan that's important to me? He loved it. We okay? It was very nice of you. Did it help? Did it take you with me? You've never been to the US? It's been one of the most important... small and few steps lost in the big round. I have a whole set of excellent facilities. I do not have time. I should have been all that time. Me and him. Small cities. Naturally. I took into the sleep no more. Into the man's heart. Of course I did. He's in the nap, was he? I love that. He's a little late. I'm going to drug in the arm. You wanted to go out and do more than steam all. I have a new I meant to my father. I did not much of a relationship after that. I want to owe you to know what he needs to make. I want to turn memory into adults on the problem. Not just the rock star father that was down there. I'm with him. I think that's all they are. That's great. That's quite a statement, everything. But if I had to ask you, what's the one thing that you never want to forget? Something that will stay with you no matter what life brings? My kids being born. Those are definitely moments you want to hold on to. The memories of their first cries. Their first smiles. I'm actually planning a trip to New York with our resumed. Just the two of us can't wait to see the results. This is the city for the first time. The city for the first time. The city for the first time. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, no. Oh, no, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You glittering idiot. You never let them see. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You glittering idiot. You never let them see. They're not the same. They're not the same. They don't know. They don't know. They don't know. I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh! Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You're all up here. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just don't know where. Could you know? Would you help me find them? Okay. They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. I've found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. Oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. Difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister? Forced me to play it. You're not supposed to scare her. Yeah, you told me that, man. I am aware I'm not what I used to be up. I've been dating so many boys and girls. I've been calling them what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet Hill. It's the darkness thing. God, if this is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, would it admit you at your gig? You seem like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quenced when you find a fresh dent. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are at Christmas. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and uncrissed. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling, and I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about new music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation is segueated to a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck and criss. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable and not to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first date, I usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and the other completely and consequential stuff. And then I just listened to what you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little gritty, but by discernment, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, like getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insist on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear, what about your late friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was our first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom so if she comes back here, please. I'm sure I think I'm a fool. Please. But by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, Che? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just get me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. And I... we have the policy that... Listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. And with this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. Do you think that's going to cover a trick or smill? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait a minute. What if I told you I can read your wine? Oh, you're kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a big bit copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we haven't stopped. They have a cop for fear being. Seriously, if I private to you and leave Europe with a bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Well, I've been it. Well, I've been it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Proud enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you guys. This is strong. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. I'm going to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check in the bill. No wallet. Now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your vet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're saying you play a slick. But here's the twist. One wink. Two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you. All app no grace. A punchline wearing her purviews trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the same. She knows the fact. So pick your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I'd been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of Kian T. Porridge. I've seen him or walk out the door. I set the table to him the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save Pune up day. Then I can count from broken lines to Persexual nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your meal. The same trace to beret. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kian Del Manjar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia. In your plight. Allora strongs. I a fanciful. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right. But we start here. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck. Just in your mind, don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, don't move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. Once that. Only the object is hidden. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I bleed. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accounting witness protection. It would better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meeper. He's a great friend of mine. He attached this big man all the answers. He's practically not hooked about it. He's real under the other. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. Slide. You know, I'm the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. My own now. Oh, I can figure out that. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. He snapped it in time with a twist repo. I don't buy a spark in a truck. I remember being so struck by how you looked when you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Freak. Or everything. Burn yourself. And as we were watching out, you were smiling and asked to lie. You just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. In the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the dawn. This was the best day of my life. The candle is flare. The base drops low. Time to compose. Now it's ready to go. And that's what we are. Very good. There you go. I think this is off. There you go. This as well. There you go. There you go. Thanks. Cheers. It was great. Thank you. So many things to clean up with. That's your first one. This is the nail. You know what you got to sculpt. You got to sculpt here as well for the first one. I saw the second one. I was sure he was supposed to be my roommate. No, he's meant to be here. First time he was going to be here. He should be here three times. Okay. I was just on the way to the mirror. He used the first time in the song. And he had to go to the air. And moved to the song. No, no, no. You literally put the habit in second time. You can go to the air. You can see him. He had to go to the song. Third time. Third time. Third time. Third time. Third time. Third time. Third time. Oh, yeah. Are you in your headphones? Yeah, you're in my headphones. The nine. This is two more paintings to do. This is quite generic. I've got to send it on. Thank you. Great job. That hits it. The space is... You got to stop here. The shambles can see it. Okay.\n",

      " Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her, but either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundary with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed, and how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me that gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too gulped up scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room. Pretending that I know where I'm going, but for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me, and I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in that ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal, but I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path, like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office, so I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing, and Joe Sturm is singing, I'm all lost in the super market, so of course I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down, and I'm thinking screw you Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says no ink. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it, it makes this hideous grinding noise inside, and notice she goes full into blur in the access to this, so I was harming it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's firing paper out, it's our sender, an alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like artics in the swanter sadness, and little Goon was there with her, she doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, I know her household, that was it, they fired me on this thought, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, out of that, just to not mess up and make an impressing one. Hey buddy, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Yeah, I can see it. Um, what do you think? Looks okay. Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Yeah, looks okay. Cool, thanks for checking, I don't want to forget it, we're heading out soon, right? Sure, and you're it, this is so fresh, I feel like I'm on MTV. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right, tell me have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster, that's why I'm going for this, something neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one the gate I played and she's just really cool, she's stunning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date, God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there and it started raining on the way like thundering down so by the time my family staggered into the restaurant I looked like I don't know a cat that had just pulled out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still and I'm panicking obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell anything, she's just sitting there so still sort of like what's her name? Adrian in Rocky is nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation even more so I'm just blabbering at her. I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest, I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone and I'll hear it to get a word in age raise and then oh Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke just like oh it just died on me and later when I'm ordering it's just Italian place. I say something dumb asking for some gee knocky or something equally ignorant and the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron and she just starts laughing and so I figuring that's it I'm dead I'm done and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it over with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it's fine because I let the opportunity speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound thinking my god this girl is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it's fine to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late so violently used to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home and the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate someone's over the major day and violets about to come back any second now convinced this guy has it against me so I've got no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering thank you to the major D and so somehow I had to get out of it so surely I can't mess it up twice in a row can I she's really special thanks for coming at such short notice I just I've got this this thing it's for violent she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that expresses what she actually means to me and I just I can't get it on the path what do you do when when you're mentally blocked maybe I just show you what I've got I have this melody but I don't know I don't know where it's going I mean I like it but where's this leading sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a top of job what my dad says I mean tell me how to do it you know tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I'm just maybe I'm just not good at this maybe that's it this is the universe tell me to just stop and do something different let me try again what do you think you think maybe this come on come play with me come on don't be scared that's it that's it keep going keep going that's the path don't What are you doing over there? I'm just putting all these bags. Thanks. I'm just putting all these bags. I'm just putting all these bags. I'm just putting all these bags. I'm just putting all these bags. I'm just putting all these bags. I'm just putting all these bags. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the way I've become pretty militant about skin training. I'm going to the gym with him and he got crushed. By the time he's on deadline, she won't be up the join us. I know we're so saddened. We're just joking about stuff. By the way, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. My music is taking off a bit, which is great, obviously. Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our in. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. I'm sorry, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. I always burst those coming up late this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories on the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create some of my physical bodies. It keeps it from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. You know? He's here with the man in mind who's made it. So, Robert Penn, it's a slip of paper. You can pin them on that board that. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what the eye is. It's an improv. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Irene. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things like that go on. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. You would always remember it being with my sister-in-law. There she is. You know, I'm pitching. She and I used to play this forest. I lived behind a family hand. This was the form of parents thought. Not places like that. Well, we're sort of sacred to this. In this weird kind of way. I guess because it was just like hours and... Whenever we went there we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? Right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We've embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles and because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just, straight, I guess, it was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something but that they just, it's just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it in just stones so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way giving just to set, I'll go see to him, maybe give him a visit to come back. Hi, hi there little buddy. That is her, that is her. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big violet, it's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as if. No, no. He misses a couple days of school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Do you listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision that one of you is still a fucking detail about you. Two days of kids to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not bad. No, no, look, violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. We're going to have to speak this later. I have people who I've been so... No, I'll... Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Speak now. Oh. Oh, sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? All of this. I heard all of this. I know, I know it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it, but by smessy, you know? And you know that was... Things are just, you know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... to be a good father. So make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see a way that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Both. I'm approaching it a little unconvincially, but violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I could already meet you on? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the other, but that all his christmas is came at one. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swaps for the big band, but like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. He explored the city. And he had Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and to the mat. Of course I take it to the nap thing. Not that. Just being closed was often closed. And he stayed up late for shows. But it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship actually left. But I want to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. You can see the trigger. Oh, which? Just use this trigger. And just press quit. Can you see it? No. One second. Yeah. Just quit. Still can't see it. I'm just seeing the... sorry. Just look straight. Just that we... Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And can you see it quit? Nope. Still. Nope. Yeah. That's what I meant. Do you want it? Quickly. Check it out. Yeah. It's because we're so deep in this space. Yeah. Sometimes the... Okay. I'm just gonna stand up with him. Sometimes the one finals can get over here and then it gets mixed messages. And that's why he gets stuck. But now I know that that's an issue. Yeah. It's on labels. I'm always around just but specifically. Yeah. Yeah. So let me know when you are back in the movie. Turn. Yeah. Okay. We should be in black now. Still in black. Still has lobby. Yeah. Okay. Still in lobby? Yeah. Okay. Still in lobby? Yep. I'm just gonna go. Still in lobby? Yep. I'm going to go. Do you want to put... Do you want to... Two? Yeah. I'm here. I was really getting into that. Mm-hmm. Can you press the button says LB5? Um-um. Um-um. Um-um. Um-um. Um-um. The wife I live over here. Two days just sometimes just to get a little bit of image. Does it disconnect? You know there are sessions? Yeah, it's a bit of a few times. Can you please tell me something? Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not... Oh, fuck. Sorry, I bought it. It's not... Oh, fuck. Sorry, I bought it. I can't see my main character. You'll come back. Oh, okay, this is the same screen. I'm not seeing it again. Sorry. No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually a love maker decision without wanting every single fucking detail by you. Two days will kill to see the world where you get... Violet, that's not bad. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. We're going to have to keep this place out. How can you provide it so? No, I'll... Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Let's speak. Bitch. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about that? I heard all of us. Okay, fine. If you're not going to say anything, I'll just tell myself. I totally won that out, you know. Things are just... You know, messy. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. It figured what helped? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US, but that all his Christmas has came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some downtime. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. He explored the city. And he had Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and until the mat, of course, I take it to the nap thing. I love that. Yes, he first, does often first. And he stayed up late for the shows, but he was him dragging the hour bed in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love the new I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memory that he looks upon the fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. So you're just learning there again? Yeah. Go, no. You know why this is like the death zone of the... Well, I'm not interested. I've learned with all the mental illness. Is this where you're intending to keep the shift? But it's just... I wasn't expecting all this mental around. And the server's behind you. That's why I told I'd sit over there. I don't know. The chair is a bit... It's okay. It's meant to be this way. Can you quit? Yeah. Oh, God. Good to go. I can't see. Oh, yeah. There. Quick. Yeah. And there are on the bar. I can use the press the Unreal one. Oh, really? It's the U. Yeah. That should bring you to the lobby. The lobby? The U, the calligraphy. Yeah. Yeah. No. Does it say Unreal Engine? Nope. Does it say anything? Nope. It's still stayed on the... Who you take it? Oh, there it is. Oh. Oh. Yeah. I'm just going to take it. Okay. Hey. Hey, you saw me in a different head sense, I forget. I forget. Oh. Very cool. It's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Um... Oh. You just missed Ori. He was just here. Um... He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. Found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. Um... How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Or... Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. Oh... I figure that is embarrassing... I had the whole time in my pocket. I'm goodness to me. But... I've been writing my memoirs which is difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything and things. And he always did that... Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest the forest we used to play in. Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, it is so embarrassing, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but when I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there and I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing, but now, dripping with water and sweat, was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond, but you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me here. Shipped it. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it that felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, Wade, into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. I know, remember thinking, my god, you're such a bravery to the sky. Then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, I've had completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, and the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? I got him really sorry, but I seemed to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of my fool. Please. Got such a. These guys said she's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle. And I, we have the policy that no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wear one and this bracelet. It was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copper fool, huh? I didn't realize we have a stock. That's a copper city. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out this. Habish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This straw is what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep but the scenes don't hold calling Gino Key like it's played at gold and post-cato pizza lands with flair.

      " a window and a bookshelf. There will be a red line and a green line some dance above your headset. That means green means you can talk, red means you can't talk. We usually say we're having to finish before you speak. The experience will happen between this room and that room. Once you move to that room you'll stay at that room. If it's not clear, when you're supposed to go to the more about it, I'll be watching that room. You want to go? Let's say or. Make sure you're out. Make sure you're out. When speaking please speak at this level. No need to sharpen. So that's why it doesn't understand it. When you are on the table, make sure that you hit properly, don't scratch it because it's just not working. Then finally, I'm just trying to remember all the things I did. That's it. The rest of that is just exploration. Just take it a shower. If you're a bad part about having an answer in the shame that different chords forever, it is your absolute for two people like you. Whatever, just don't drink on my beer. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to tidy up before heading out. So what's the vibe for dinner? French, Italian, Chinese or should we just slum it with some burgers? Burgers. The good old burger joint. Let's go make some crushed more choices with extra cheese and fries. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tastes a little creepy. I totally get that. Sometimes the vibes can be a bit off. But hey, a good burger can fix almost anything. Actually, yes, for sure. Where's my burger? Absolutely. A juicy burger with some good company is hard to beat. It really is. It's all about the journey. Plus, once we dig into that burger, everything will be right in the world. Life's all about finding joy in the little things, like a great meal shared with friends. Those moments make all the difference. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. The gumber is sending me to the...copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places of total days. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum-scared of little gumber to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensued to eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear a little gunbe yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number dials, and I'm thinking, Scream, you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. Scream in the front panel says, no, aim. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And I look, she goes full into the blur and the access to this. So I was harming it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little gunbers there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, an asshole. That was it. They fired me on this talk. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impressing for once. Can we see your jacket out there? I just want to make sure it's not getting too chilly for us. I'm, what do you think? Is there any possible universe in which she wear this for the day? Yeah, looks pretty good. Where'd you pick that up? I really appreciate you checking on that. Staying warm is key. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I really appreciate you checking on that. Staying warm is key, especially when we're out enjoying the night. I found it at a little shop downtown. They have some great vintage pieces. It's all about keeping the vibe alive while staying to close. Thanks a lot. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first day? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the gay tech plate. And she's just really cool. She's stoned to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like... Across between broke shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So, still sort of like a... In Rocky. It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how... Chris Isaac stormed my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get in word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some g-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but f*** it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But, probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, I'm finding this violent opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell-bound. Thinking, my God, this girl is so f***ing cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and told her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ride late so, while it leads to go to bathroom, I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole g-knocky gate, someone's over the matri-day. And violence about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matri-day takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering to the matri-day. And so, somehow, I had to get out of it. So, surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming to such a short moment. I've got this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday commemorative. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. But what you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell me a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to stop and do something different. I mean, just... Come on. Let me try again. What did you say? Maybe this? Come on. I'm sorry with me. Mom, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing here? Come here. Maybe something... I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. There's a window. There's a window. There's a window. I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. I'll just put it all this bad. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted it to me, but by the end of the completely militant of our sleep chain and going to the game with them, you're crushed. By the send them up, she's on the line so she won't be able to join us. I know I know worse her setup. We're just joking a bit of stuff and then while it came part of she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off for that which is great obviously, but sometimes sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take her out. Anyway, look, everything's great. It really is. Orees, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to love a little bit of a favour. Always I was thinking about how people got rid of memories for the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create some in physical violence. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know now. I think it'd be really cool for what it's older. See what it was around in my room space. So, Robert Pan, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board there. I think you could do this. I think you could love it. I don't really know what they are in here. It's still a weird thing. When I spend time with Orie, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realise what a tenfold thing memory is. He would already be the month they're doing with my sister-in-law. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents' dog. That place was like... Well, we saw a sacred tourist in this weird kind of work. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. And to come up with people. Live otherwise. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carrying it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stones so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way, is he? Just a set. I'll go see to the lady who came here, who's in too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's sheer custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days of school because I want to take him on tour, I'm going to spend some wonderful time with my son. For not. What do you mean? What do you mean? You missed yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm asking the masters of mildest making decisions, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Did you just ask your kids to see the world the way you get? Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. We're going on to pick this later. I have people around, so... No, I'll... Yeah, I'll clear that. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Fitch! Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, it's coming. How much did you hear about? Quite a lost. Yeah. But I wouldn't know what to say either. I just don't have any answers to that. Things are just... You know, messy. I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.E. that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventional. Violet just went to see you like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took over to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US. Because all his criticism came at once. There were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew he'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more and to the mat to have courtside tickets at the nap today. I loved it. This dream film is just awesome. And we stayed up late for the shows. But it was human drug in the hour bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you. I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. You see just moving. You are exactly the worst. I'm just going to quit you from this. I'm going to quit. Can you quit? Can you go back to the unreal? You should go back to your lab. This is the problem with the basement. The Nalan University. You're exactly behind the server. Especially if you go back. I have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. Who's helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plan. I'm so sorry I forgot. That isn't embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness to me. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? I was scared. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys and girls. Recallings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's an enormous thing. God, I did this. It was 1990. I was running 15 minutes late. I worked there. I started to worry. When it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you don't already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like you were completely afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segue into a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. And I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, yeah. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... You sure think I'm a fool? Please. And by you are a fool. Geno? What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a aware one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I couldn't read your mind? Oh, you're going to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a star. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So why did you go up to lose at this point? Glad, Ben. Glad, Ben. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. But Brian, after being dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold calling Genokey. Like it's played at gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean. And you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depth. You can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now. Oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch. Hope you think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm. I'm. I'm. Under the neon sky. My friend. Your act is charming. But near the end. One wrong move. One misreply. And your on-dish duty. No. All of by the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the bake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye. I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me. I'm just genome. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor. Walk out the door. I set the table. Turn the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save punal tape and I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your knee. You're the same trash to beret. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mea in your plight. A lora strones by a fan cool. I am not a man. I'm genome. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay. No pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left or right. We'll start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind. Don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are. Now, you can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping. And no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. I would better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw. He's a quick friend now. He attests this big man all those answers, suspecting not for Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Parlor tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know this anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madhawna ma. Look at Figada. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked your life. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. In a red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flair. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's how much. Okay. Okay.\n",

      " I'm holding. I'm not very quite, yes. Yes, perfect. Cool. Just make sure you put it on hold. It's on the right hand. Perfect. Yeah, that's it. And if you have a pocket... I don't, but I can just position it this way. Is that a risk? Cool. Yeah, you're so comfortable for your head. Cool. Okay, high two back. How you doing? I know your face from Venice. Right, so... In a perfect world, you would actually be sitting outside, waiting to enter this room, but obviously infrastructure. So, this is the way I've to do it. A couple of things to be aware of. I'll be in the room right now, at the beginning, just to make sure that you see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Oh, okay, cool. There will be a red line and a green line, so I'm going to answer it off your headset. That means green means you can talk red means you can't talk. We usually say, wait for him to finish before you speak. Okay. The experience will happen between this room and that room. Once you move to that room, we'll stay in that room. Okay. If it's not clear, when you're supposed to go to them, where about it, I'll be watching that until when to go. And it's A or. Yeah, mix reality. Mix reality. Yeah. When speaking, please speak at this level. No need to sharpen. No need to be like this. Okay. So, otherwise it doesn't understand it. When you are on the tail, make sure that you hit it properly. Don't scratch it, because it's just not going to do anything. I hope it's just kind of that. And then finally, just try and remember all the things I just thought you. That's it. Okay, cool. And the rest of that is just exploration, exploration. Okay, wonderful. Okay. Good? Yeah. Okay. Okay, so, behind you, door? Mm-hmm. Window? Mm-hmm. And then, push up. Okay. And then, thank you. Thanks a lot. You should jump in there. Just open your door. And you can jump in there, and then you can start off on your behind. How many will you make on your legs. Next, getÈ≠î cathedral. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I meant to tidy up before heading out. So what's the vibe for dinner? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it with some burgers? Burgers. I don't know if we're just... That's too much to crush on the choice of French. You're too little creepy. I totally get that. Sometimes the vibes can be a bit off, but hey, good burger can fix on this dinner. Excellent. Yes, for sure. Where's my burger? Absolutely. It really is. It's all about the journey. Plus, once we dig into that burger, everything will be right in the world. Life's all about finding joy in the little things. Like a great meal, shared with friends. Those moments make all the difference. Man, it's good to see you in. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, intention. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she's got the tone. She's sort of, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumbo. You know, for a marioca. So, there I am this morning, little gumbo summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And I see some duplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns up. The gumbo summons me to a new company. I know it doesn't sound like much. This fucking machine, I swear. Sarah, mind you little gumbo. Just finding this thing is not a fooling question. It's like, on the other side of building, I have a place to sit and talk to her. But I'm a little bit angry with her. And so, God don't scare the little gumbo which must be that way. So, I just don't write a proper answer. I know I'm going to do it. But if you're on this time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I'm trying to put three parts of the stars in the course of the middle of the day. You certainly realize that I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite where there's two slip Charlie Sheet types of suits to eyeball me. And I know I'm supposed to have the exact pull that I would fucking tell her. So, I just keep my head down and try to make out what I could be doing to her. But I know the company rooms are the most important. So, I get out of there. I start dashing by the down on the screen. I'm setting fire in the path. I'm finding the path. Like, I'm in the end of James' way, but you know, the stars are all going to try to escape with the idle and shit that's coming in from the wall side. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water bath. I start getting a little gumball yellow from the back of the office. So, I'm freaking out. And I run down into the bedroom of the basement. And the G-Box is playing Joe Stormy's singing. I'm on a bar, it's the new suit, the market. So, of course, I take that as some kind of sign from GodBang fundamental to do. But then, somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents, I'm hiding them over there. I'm making a stream of Joe Stormy, I am lost, I'm making a mess call. And the alarm goes off. The stream will start calling since. So, I've done it with him. I'm soÔøΩ about this point. I just start hammering the coffee. And then I open it up. And it's like a children's room. And this is pretty exciting, because it's all. I'm literally as full of the player against the stars. And I'm calling it to me. And I'm looking around on the girls or the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's vitamin A, where I was outside of the room, and I'm art sounding. Which stuff unless you're from the room, says to see what's happening, and she just, I'm looking. I'm starting on the wrong side, this is a super big issue. Covenant in, looking at like art takes and swap the sadness. And a little doom with that, she doesn't see anything. She just stands there smiling. She's smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew, and I asked for it. That was it. They showed me on this party a minute, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of there. Just, to knock myself up and make an impression for once. What do you think? Is that Andy also the University of Michigan, where I was for the day? Yeah, looks pretty good. Where'd you pick that up? I really appreciate you checking on that. Staying warm is key, especially when we're out enjoying the night. I found it at a little shop downtown. They have some great vintage losses. It's all about key. I'm sure you're right. I'm sure you're right. It's all about keeping the vibe alive whilst it's a close-up. Let's go. Let's go. You have to understand. It's important how I get this right. So, have you ever heard of any bad stuff? A total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something new, shall we know? Hopefully, I'm actually not going to lose time. Her name's Violet, and I know one key, too. She's just really healthy. She's a stone to the north town, and she's stunningly beautiful. Like, across between Brook Shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just very smart. I don't know about that for the first time. I don't know. I was so lame. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsals. I tried to jam myself until a pair of trousers. I didn't do anything too. So, I missed the bus and ended up wanting to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the street, I don't know. A cat that just crawled out of the urinal. And she's just sitting there quietly in the sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really need anything. She's just sitting there. So, she's still sort of like an, what's an agent in Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blabbering out of her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how precise I'd storm my name. And my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story about stopping for breath. Let alone allowed her to get a word and I'd raise her then. Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd be talking on stop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried buying the mood by telling a joke. And just, oh, god, I just died on it. And later on I'm warning her, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, Rocky or something is good either in. And the way she's just staring at me like I'm a war. She's just, just, just, hot laughing. And so, I should figure out if that's it. I'm dead. I'm dumb. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You do. I don't have soul. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool. Fuck it over the very first young shoe. Why is it wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. And finally, it's finally the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about architecture. And creating intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how it dreams to want they buy some land so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash until it was back to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I only let it so... Finally, I used to go to bathroom. And I'm about to deal with it when I realized... I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole team knock again, summons over the major day. And violinist's about to come back any second now. And who thinks this guy has against me. So I've got no more dignity left to say, right? So I just thought one to many is in front of me. And I'm offering them a rupture. Any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner. If they just... If they'll just... But the love of God can be a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me. And agrees just as violent what's back in. And I'm still my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm trying my she legs once whispering. To the major D. And so... Somehow... I had too much to get out of it. So... Surely I got messed up twice in a row. Can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming to such short notice. I just... I've got this... This thing... It's for violinist. She's got a breath. I just wanted to write it something. Something that... Expresses what she actually used. I just... I can't... Get it on my path. But what you do when... When you're mentally blocked. Or you're extremely blocked. I have this feeling. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? She turns I think I should just let this music go. Yeah, proper job. But what my dad says, I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell me how to play, find, or play, find, or... Has been no right. What actually means to you? I'm at this... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... To stop and do something different. Come on. You'll try again. I'm so... Okay. Yes? Come on. Come on, you're good. Come on, you're good, you scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the... I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. Make yourself a... Just put your hands back over there. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I know where it starts out of. It just... Just over and stuff like that. About a pit part. It's under a lot of pressure. She and I were... Like shit in the back. Well, here's a take-off for that, which is great on this place. But... It's on the ground. Sometimes I have long enough to tidy up the person in the pit. I don't know. Anyway... I just need to try. Because it is already... It's amazing. It's like... Best day of my life. It's fine. I have to try this. I want to do this. I always practice this. I can't do this. I don't know how... I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I want it to be a crisis in the physical world. Keep safe. I want to talk to you. I just wanted to talk to you about the message. It should be what I need, I need an atmosphere session. I think it's better to start. Come on, whatever. What? You know... What you know now or what you wish you know now. That's all. It's a great corner, I don't know. Yep. See what's about it in this place. So... I'm gonna have to do this. Is it the table? Yeah, it's the table. I'm gonna have to do the one that I'm gonna have. I think you should do this. I think you should do the one. I don't... Here's the one that I have. It's so weird. When I spend the time with all of you, I remember this is my job. I think it's actually the same. You need to be very much. You got it. Well, I think you need my sister. There she is. I'm not thinking. She knows you're playing this far as well. I'm kind of hungry now. I'm not playing this far. Well... The sword, the safety, is weird kind of work. I guess, like hours and... Whenever we went there, we... ...eight years early behind. Probably people. Live on the line. Because we're a kid. Right? So... We're literally living in our imaginations of that. Because they're whole kingdom, driving its castles. Because they just felt so... ...this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea of the magnetic field. One day we got lost on that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. She just... ...stranged, I guess. There's the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean... I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But, she found like an eternity in time. I was going to... ...you have no real set of consequences in that age. What it means to actually do something that... ...that day. Okay. She's not the new field. I guess, that's why I wanted to have something to worry. Something permanent. It's an instant, so it can't be lost, right? Oh! The master of the way, is it? Just to set... ...you're seated with a big engineer. He's into the problem. Hi. How do you get a little buddy? Oh, give me a break. Mr. Tuday is forming. Fighters, share, custody. Fighters, follow the kids to cheer, I say it. No. No. There's a school, no one to take. No, I'm not going to spend some quality time with my son. He's not much of a kid. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Don't understand, Violet. I'm not into the clouds. Money up is different, but what can you think about? You can't play the game with things all the way again. Violet also has that. No. Sounds good, Violet. Violet isn't a big long height. I don't think it's like that height. I think that's how it goes. No, I'll... Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Time. Fizz! Oh. Sorry. Let's do... Let's do... You go to the next one. How much? This is very popular. You're quite a lost. Yeah. I wouldn't know what to say. Something just... Don't I think, you aren't seeing it, do you? You're just... You know? That's it. You got to try and... To be a good father. To make it work. Pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either after. You know? Especially Victorian on time. Well... I'm approaching it in a little longer than I should have. Violet is my serial number. Did I ever tell you about the time I took away from you? I don't know. I'm just... The... Lovely. You don't have to come for a show. There's no glass of anything. I just think I've got to help. I'll take a wimmy. Never been to the US. That all is a piece of cake once. But no one's more sure. Small, acoustic swaps for the big pounds that like the concert. Exquisite. I'd even lost a dollar. I wish then all my time to get. Me and him. He's all the city. I can't believe he lost that. I just think that the sleep of war into the bands of course I think is an act here. Not that. The sleep of the stars. It's a big complaint. The show's going to be a few drugging me out. But anybody wants to go out and do more than see more. I'll video on that. I did have much of a relationship. I'm doing that. But I want to owe you to it. I want to tell you that we've looked from the bottom. Not just the rock star part that's never there. I'll put everything that's all they are. I'm going to bring you. I'm going to bring you. I'm going to bring you. I'm going to bring you. You see just moving. You are exactly the worst spot of wifi. Stay there. I'm just going to quit you from this. If you can just quit. Can you quit? Can you go back to the unreal? No go back to your lobby? This is the problem with being down in the basement. Okay. And not in the university. You're exactly behind us. No, dammit. You're exactly in. Especially if you go back. You are in the middle. Sorry about that. It doesn't know when to actually take over again. Are you in the lobby now? Back in the main lobby. No. Yeah, dark now. Thank you very much. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're good. No, you're fine. It's just, it's a problem of the space. All good. Sorry, I didn't believe I mean. Let me have a look at you. My god, you look so well. You're all the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. It's just here. It was helping me try to find... He was just here. He must have had to be. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I leave them to read it, learnt so. They're definitely here. I'm certain I'll be better. I don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could read the bookshelf. Or, or, or, or in the company. Found a lab for. Or the drawer. Or the sofa. Or, or, or maybe under the table. Um, how about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or, or the piano. Or, or the plant. Oh, that's so sorry I forgot to shift the cap. Oh, here. That is a virus. I should help them hold my locket. I've been racing my memory. That was just a different problem than I am. And losing everything seems. Who always did that? Did I do that at the time I lost my sister? Oh, it's me. That was scary. I, I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting to the bus. And, according to what they remember. I got this one from Byletton. It's the darkness thing. There it is. God, it is. It is so embarrassing that here it goes. It was 19 or 18 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rested at a restaurant and I did work there. And I started to worry. And you were tired of me. I mean, when it made you write your name, you seem like this is possibly cool, young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me. It was really impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back there. And so I just ran you a check. I never went missing out on the men and the apostles and to the restaurant. But it was a deal. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god. I'm so sorry I missed a boss and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you know, I already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me here. Sheptid. It was like picking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely in a freight to show yourself. And then the conversation said, we needed to a story about your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And that was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable in that to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first days, I was usually only involved in small talk. So now, remember thinking, like, I, there's such a great reason for this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. I was in braveness myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. And I wasn't paying attention. So I didn't get with it to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And yeah, other completely consequential stuff. And I was like, I'm just, like, you're really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little boring, but I just start. I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like, the house, the garden, the child. I'm like, I need to move together. I want it all in it. And later you and sister, I'm paying you to make up for your family. So I excuse myself for what you did. Oh yeah. I'm really sorry, but I've seen you have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow and I'm paying. I swear. What about your late friend? Surely she hasn't come to wallet as well. No, this was my first date. And I was really late. And I had seen someone paying before she went to the bathroom. She goes back here, visit. She'll think of a fool. Please. And by your own fool. G-Dol. What's that shit? This guy says he's looking for a wallet. It's true. And my date's gonna come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I sort of got to come back tomorrow and settle. We have the policy that's... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. This race that it was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I know. And it's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's gonna cover a trick or something? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your wine? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Oh yeah. Is that how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second, wait a second. So do you think you're gonna be comfortable, huh? I didn't realize we haven't stopped. They're the comforts, didn't you? Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and then clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what if you got to lose at this point? That bit... That bit. But if you go wrong, we just lost out the shwasha. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Kavish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Riding off the pretensions. Hmm? Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertaining in for you tonight. This strums... What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but scenes don't hold callin' Genokey. Like it's played at gold and post-cato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean and you, your scribbles on a magazine, your flash of smile, trip on grace. You're trying to leave but lost the pace under the neon sky. You've been guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that's sweet. I've got depths you can't repeat, you twitch, you grin. You check the bill, no wallet now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promised to return bedgiven a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. You all had no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stains. She saw the seam, she knows the face, so pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope. She don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin. The lights set slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major day, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just genome. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a morgue walk out the door. I set the table to the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night. I've saved you, no tale that I can count. From broken lines to per-second nights, I've turned disasters into flare. With just the gradsie and the stare you brought your grin. Your little show, but feel your knee or the st. Trusted array. You played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the candelman. Jar, I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama, me of in your flight. I'm lost, drones, by a fan call. I'm not a man. I'm genome, don't even try. Great, just great. Sure as where you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right, but we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump on and look at the bottom of the molding. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. Once that, I'll need the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I bleed. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accounting witness protection. Better here. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meepo. He's a great friend of mine. He tests this big man all his answers, he's practically not looking at the breath. He'll have to get out of there. Slide. Slide. Powered tricks on. The fat may must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not a ear, which means this is your object. I don't own now. He's the guy I don't. Oh, he's the spot, you know, velvet storm. Snack as time went between some people. I was on the fire. I was on the fire. I was on the fire. They were gonna be so struck by how you looked when you looked at the train. It was the same way you looked when you came. Three. One and four. They're sleeping. Twenty-eight. They guys, they, they, they know we were demais. Like it just shook your head until,ËÉñINE knew the water. Where they don't spend the time in the same room with you. And you walk outside. You're ready, in those sunset covers the streets of Christine. This was the best day of the day. The best day of the day. The best day of the day. The best day of the day. The best day of the day. That's how much. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much. Let's come off to you. Thank you. Welcome. That was great. One of your characters looks really intense. Yes. All the characters are changing. Character is changing. We stop one more thing to do. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great.\n",

      " and then you have the head to the door and come through the space but the infrastructure. One would begin, I'll be in the room, just want to actually see a door or window and a workshop. That's correct and I know that everything is fine. A couple of hints to come in. There will be a red line and a green line to the glass in your head. Green means you can speak red means you're a disabled, you can't speak in that one. We'll always say that letting finish before you speak. Yes, I think we could look at that in audio recorder. Sorry. So make sure that you... There we go. That's the one. Sorry about that. I'll just stick it back on the audio. When you speak, speak at this level. It's not neat to shout, it's just a good level. The experience will have an intro room. This is the first room. At some point you're going to have to move to that room. Don't worry, if you don't know where it is, I'll be watching you. I can tell you where you're at the side. When you use the table, make sure that you use it hard. Which people... I tell it in the end of doing this. And then... And then... Did it do it in there? Yes, that's pretty much it. The last thing is... Be bold and brave and look around for things as you wish. Right? Great. Is it? I'm not sure that the quest 3 is going to go over my glasses. I don't know. I have some pretty thick ones. I have some thick ones. Okay. The ones on the screen. That's a bit happy to... Yeah. Just push it back. There you go. Oh no. No. No. It's not in there. They're just a bit too big. Normally I just forgot to bring my VR glasses. So is that going to screw up your... No, not really. I mean, more about you. It makes you believe you can see. Yeah. As long as this... Do you want me to put you in the closet somewhere? Yeah. I can just put them in my pocket here. You sure have to. I can just put it up there for a second. No. I can't. Alright. Alright. Alright, so... Alright. So... Okay. Alright. So... Okay. So... Okay. You can put your glasses in. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. So... Kenny, am I raising my anger Up! I'd wake it up at theÂ§ç but not! You know, we're all proud, but remember, you do feel need to call that once in a while. Can't wait to hear all the bad news during Christmas. Maybe you would love to own a one more thing. You remember to bring that cake to the one that made you out of love. Thank you. You know the drill, make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me, take on me, I'll be gone. Hello, Red. And now I really need to work with my high pitch. Just two seconds. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up before heading out. But since we're eating out anyway, what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese or should we just slum it with some burgers? Something new, huh? Okay. But if we end up eating something that's still moving on the plate, I'm blaming you. Okay, well, how about Mexican? Well, Mexican food, that's a great choice. I didn't even think of that. It'll be a delicious surprise for sure. I mean, yeah, we could do some tequila shots. Now that's an exciting twist. I'm all in for some fun, especially if it means good vibes and laughter. Do you prefer a mezcal? We could do a mezcal. That's a wild idea. I didn't see that coming, but it sounds like a blast. mezcal has such a unique flavor. It's definitely a cool option to make it. I love exploring different drinks. I totally agree. So you love exploring your drinks? There's something special about sharing those experiences with friends. It really adds to the whole vibe of the night. Absolutely. Exploring new drinks is like a mini adventure in itself. Each sip tells us all the fun. It's even better when shared with good company. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Oh, that's really too bad. I'm so sorry to hear about you losing the job. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning, a little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. There might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumba to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set putting the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Sturm is singing. Amor last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up with a document and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. Screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. That is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no one goes full into blur in the excess. So I was vomiting in like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression of you for once. Can you check if my jacket is out there? I really hope it didn't get left behind. Yeah, your jacket's here. Um. Hey, what do you think? Is that a white symbol universe in which I should wear this to the day? Maybe not. But you know, what about this one? Why don't you? Oh, I just want to play guitar. Fly me to the moon. I guess I'm. Yes, I've been playing for a while now. It helps me unwind and express what I feel. But sometimes it makes me even more anxious when I'm trying to impress someone. It's funny how a song like that can capture so much emotion, right? Music has a way of putting everything into perspective. It definitely adds to the pressure when you're about to go on a date. You're on a really bad first date. Yes. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her one day to play it. And she's just really cool. She's stoned to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like... Across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Yeah? Well, looks pretty good. Pretty good. What happened on the first date? I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up riding to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incognizate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how... Crystic storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word in age raised and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's just Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...and she's just... ...start laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? I'm just... ...a little bit more... ...sickly. But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...percreative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... ...spelbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...till it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so... ...while at least to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate... ...someones over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have. And I'm just going to have to go back and get some rest. I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees... ...just as Violet walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. So the major day. And so somehow... ...I had to get out of it. So surely I got myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. It's a common at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on my path. What do you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... HA! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. Maybe just... HA! I'm trying to go. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Sure. Come on, don't be scared. I'm not scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. You're not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Go ahead. Try it. Go ahead. What you doing over there? Come here. Other next room. There's a place where you can sleep. Other next room. There's a place where you can sleep. There's a place where you can sleep. And there's a place where you can sleep. There's a place where you split up off. It reminded me of you doing a cuffing, of hair for a cry.ÔøΩ You were keeping me up until now though, How I don't want you, I live my memories, How I cry of you. Sometimes I hear a divine echo, that makes me cry, It seems to me that I want you, I want you so much, so much, so much as you are, I simply ask the morning. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the night I become pretty militant about speech-train, and going to the game with him and you got crushed. By the sender-mob, she's on the deadline, so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, we're just joking about stuff at the moment. By the campar, she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously, but sometimes, sometimes we don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our enemies. Anyway, look, everything's great. It really is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. I was always birth-based coming up late to this month, and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of my physical bodies. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing the message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when he's older. See what was around him when he was eight years. So, Robert Pan, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that order. Thank you for doing this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are and you know, things from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orie, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a ten-poor thing I'm like in. You with Orie, you must be being with my sister, miss. There she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family home, this was before my parents died. And that place was like, you know, it was sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the 80s and the need behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. The one day Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day, clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't he? Just a sat. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet him. He's into Brumby. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. And so he's here. I think it broke in it. I mean, trees. You're in trees. But probably all crooked and things like that. There's a bit of flicker. We're going to quit if you can just quit from here. You can grab the controller. Just if you can just go through the controller. Oh, with this one? With this one. Okay. So, uh, quit. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah? Yeah, when you're up. And then in the bar there should be a U. Yeah. Hit the U. Okay. I'll just put you in the next scene. Really? We know about this both, so. Hmm. Tell me when you're in the lobby. Yup. In the lobby. And then tell me when he goes up. Dark. Perfect. Okay. Oh, can you, uh, miss two days. It's not big. You're by the top. Shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school, because I want to take him on tour, and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the movie. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he'd been. Jesus, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a lads-maker decision, but I'm wondering if we still fucking need to sell Violet. Jesus, days are killed to see the world the way he gets. Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. What else? I don't know what else. Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's the time. Speak now. Fitting. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I would say most of it. Probably all of it. I know, I know, it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it, but by its message, you know? It's interesting how we hold on to memories, isn't it? Sometimes, I wonder if we can ever really capture everything we want to remarry. I'm trying to be a good father. I'm trying to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventional. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I had to meet you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and it was very last minute, but it figured what helped. I'll take him with me. He never been to the US. It was like all his Christmas, it came at once. There were some small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of it. Exclusivity. I knew he'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat. So I have the quartz, I take it to the nap to the end. I love that. Just few fans, those also. You can see that light, the shows. But it was him dragging the arbet in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the good rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm worried. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? It could be something simple or something profound. Just something that sticks with you. Well, my son. I want to remember my son. That's beautiful. Children have this incredible way of embedding themselves in our hearts, don't they? I find myself constantly cherishing the small everyday moments with Auri. They make everything else worthwhile. Yes, I understand. There's a certain depth to the bond we share with them isn't there. It's like they become a part of us, shaping not just who we are, but also how we see the world. Well, I see kids as being quite live as a way of reminding us of what really matters, doesn't it? Those little eyes looking up at you filled with curiosity about the climate that they are, challenge us to be better and to hold on to every moment. Please. No, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Or she was. She was. She was. She was. She was. She was. She was. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. How big was the shot? Oh, cheer, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness to me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in. That was scary. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes, recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I was in the restaurant and you weren't there. I started to worry that you would actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed a buzz and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only a word of me. Of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely in a fright to show me yourself. And then the conversation said, you're just a sad way into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. All my other first dates have usually only involved small talk. So I know, remember thinking, oh my god, you're such bravery to this guy. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I was in braving of myself and then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and yeah, other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted a reading with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Problem? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was her first day and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino. What's up, chair? This guy says he's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then in a minute, so please just cut me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a whore one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh, yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? I didn't realize we have a stop. David Copperfield here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost out this washer. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and you're. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Collin Gino Key, like it's plated gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. You're a real man. You're a real man. You're a real man. That's real. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I have to go. I have to go. I have to go. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming. But near the end, one wrong move. One mistreply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps your sim. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink. Two slow. One move. You missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. I'm wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fate. So pick your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye. I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I said slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table. Turn the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, no, say, that I can count. From broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trace to beret. You played your part. I won't deny. But you can't trick the kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama mea. In your plaa. A lora strones. By a fancou. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left to right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He says more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we'd better hear. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw's. He's a Craig Fender now. He tests this big man, all those ounces, practically not for Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Pilot traits, huh? Your family must be thrilled. You know that there's anymore. They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Ma the orna ma gifigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, but you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. That's as far as we've gotten. Okay. Good.\n",

      " Okay. Good morning. Hi, how are you? Good, how are you? Good. Good. So, first things first, obviously. In a perfect space, you wouldn't be coming in like this, where I should be outside. And then you have the headset and everything, then you will open the door and come into the space. Okay. Infrastructure, so this way. Yeah. When we begin, I'll be in the room. Just want to make sure you can see a door, a window, and a bookshelf. Okay. That's correct, and I know that everything is fine. A couple of things to know. There will be a red line and a green line, some glass on your headset. Green means you can speak, red means you're listening. Okay. Or you can't really speak at that moment. We will always say that, let him finish before you speak. Okay. Yes. And we can have a quick look at that audio recorder. Yeah. Sorry. I just want to make sure there we go. H1. I saw it. It's around it. It is indeed. Yeah. Sorry about that. No problem. And is that, I'll just stick it back in my pocket. Just stick it back in your pocket. Yes, do you? Cheers. When you speak, speak at this level. No need to shout. We're just a good, a good laugh. The experience will have an intro room. This is the first room. At some point you're going to get asked to move to that room. When you move to that room, you're just staying in that room for the rest of the experience. Okay. Don't worry. If you don't know where it is, I'll be watching you and I can tell you to be at the other side. Yeah. When you use the table, make sure that you use it hard. Most people, I tell them in the end of doing this, in the middle of the room, just do that. Okay. And then, do do do do do do do do do do do. Yeah. That's pretty much it. The last thing is, be bold and brave and look around for things as to wish. Yeah. Great. I'm not sure that the Quest 3 is going to go over my glasses. I don't know. I have some pretty thick ones. You've had some pretty big ones. Okay. Well, I'm super happy to... Let me just push it back. Put it back. There you go. And no. No. It's not in. They're just a bit too big. Normally, I just forgot to bring my VR glasses. So, is that going to screw up your... No, not really. I mean, it's more about you, make sure that you can see. Yeah. Yeah. It's fine. As long as this... Do you want me to put your glasses on? I can just put them in my pocket here. They should be fine. You sure? I can just put them up there for a second. Nah. Okay. Alright, so let's... Start. I'm sure I'll make sure that we have volume this all the way up. Go behind you. This should be a door. Yeah. Okay, in the way up. Uh-huh. And... Good luck, Chef. Yeah? Amazing. I'll do it that way. I'll do it that way. You never know where I am. Remember, maybe they'll keep you all that fast in the wild. But like, you will pass. You can even touch you. Or, you'll probably be able to even let it be pretty fast. Just take it a shower. Okay. You know the cheer. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just a drink or my beer. I'm going to shake it. I'm going to shake it. I'm going to shake it. Just a few seconds. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up before heading out. But since we're eating out anyway, what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it with some burgers? Something new, huh? Okay. But if we end up being something that's still moving on the plate, I'm blaming you. Okay. Well, how about Mexican? Well, Mexican food. That's a great choice. I didn't even think of that. It'll be a delicious surprise for sure. I mean, yeah, we could do some tequila shots. I'm asking excited twist. I'm all in for some fun. Especially if it needs good vibes and laughter. Do you prefer a mezcal? We could do, like, a mezcal. Yeah. But it sounds like a blast. mezcal has such a unique flavour. It's definitely a cool option to mix things up. I love exploring different drinks. I really agree. So you love exploring new drinks? There's something special about sharing those experiences with friends. It really adds to the whole vibe of the night. Absolutely. Exploring new drinks is like a mini adventure in itself. Each sip tells a story. And it's even better when shared with good company. Man is good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, I can't tell you. Oh, that's really too bad. I'm so sorry to hear about you losing the job. She comes. Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's had one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, from Maria Kat. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the...copy room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man. I swear, Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of building, the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gunned scared of little gumber to us without wrenching. So I just stop running from room to room, sending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I tried to get the three fighter stairs in a cross, and then up again. And suddenly I realized I'm on the top floor. It's the accepted suite. And these two slip-challenge sheen types in suit to eyeball me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set pulling that I would fucking tell. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down on the screen and then myself find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this, but you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I could get a little gumber to yell in through the back of the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the back room of the basement. And the duke box is playing in Joe Stummer's singing. I'm a lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents, lining the number down and thinking, screw you, Joe Stummer. I have lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I'm gonna press copy. And I'm gonna walk it on. Scream, front panel, sit, bow, hip. So I fill it with ink. I'm so desperate by this one. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. I can't kill it. I make this hideous grinding of the time. And looks like it goes full in the air in the existence. So I was palmetin' in, like, everywhere on the brills, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was asking the alarm sounding. The staff are rushing from the office to see what's happening. And it's just me. It's standing alongside this screaming machine. Coveted in, looking like art types in the swamp of sadness. And little goombas there, but she doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Smiling, like, she's thinking. See, I knew, an asshole. That was it. They fired me on this pot. I mean, it's just the job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of there. Just to knock me up and make an impression for once. Can you check in my jacket, is that what I really want to do? Yeah, your jacket's here. I'm... Hey. What do I think? Maybe not. But, you know, what about this one? I don't know. I'm... Hey! What do I think? What do I think? Maybe not. You know, what about this one? Why don't you... Do you play guitar? Fly me to the moon? Yes, I've been playing for a while now. It helps me unwind and express what I'm using. But sometimes it makes me even more anxious when I'm trying to impress someone. It's funny how a song like that can capture so much emotion, right? Music has a way of putting everything into perspective. But it definitely adds to the pressure when you're about to go on a date. Yes, I've had to... The first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... Mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet and I met her on the G-Tech Play. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect and she's funny and beautiful. Like, across between brought shields and journey for Connolly. And she's just... Really smart. Yeah? Well, it looks pretty good. What happened on the first date? I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. She's still sort of like a... What's an ageing? In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a concert even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how... Chris Isaac stole my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in age raised. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for something... ...Gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I'm figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is it wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...till it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so... ...why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky guy summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to say, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and... ...I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm... ...time machine lace whilst whispering to the major D. And so somehow I had too much to get out of there. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Alright, so come on to such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. I've been doing that expresses what she actually means to me. I just can't get it on the path. But what you do when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, Robert. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, Robert. Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. What my dad says, I mean. Help! Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just going to go to this. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's the universe telling me to just stop and do something different. Maybe I'm just... Ah! And try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come clearly. Sure. Come on, don't miss it. I'm not scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Princess! Please swear to God! What are you doing over there? Come here. I'll make you something else. I'll just put you on the table. I'll let you make sure. I'll make you something else. I'll make you something else. I'll make you something else. I'm all in. Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted it to be normal, but by the night I put some military in the tank. I'm going to get within your crush. By the centre-mount, she's on the right side. She's on the right side. I know, I know where she's at. We're just doing a bit of stuff. By the campar and she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were like, ships in her night. I'm using it to take her off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes you don't have long enough to type the up person in to keep her off. Anyway, everything's great. Really, it is. Oh, he's amazing. It's like the best day of my life every day. It's smart. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. I always burst those coming up later this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories for the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. And it keeps saying, on this part, this existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's pretty much about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd know now. I think it's pretty cool for myself though. No, see, it was an album. So, running out of the slip of paper, you can pin them on up all of that. I think you could trade this. I think it's going to work. I don't really know what they are looking for. It's so weird. I want to spend time with all of you. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things like the dawn. It made me realize what's a cool thing I like it. You know, it's the month we've been with my sister, but there she is. A pitch. She and I used to play this far. Behind our family home. This was the former parents part. And that place was like, well, sorry, sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we believed we were taking it and we're leaving behind. We'd come up with people. And live by the wife. Because we were kids, right? So, literally living in our imagination, you can bet all kingdoms driving this castle. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. We've already got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just showed, I guess, the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but we found like an eternity at the time. I was young. You have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually do something. And then, I can't find a completely different. Just how easy it is to lose something with that. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of it. Something permanent. Etch existence, so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, Gizoo. Just to set, I'm going to see you two of them. Hi, hello, buddy. How is he? How is he? Hi, hello, buddy. How is he? How is he? How is he? I think it broke, didn't it? I mean, trees. You're in trees, but probably you're like crooked and things like that. There's a bit of flicker. Yeah, give me a second. That's okay. We're going to quit. If you can just quit from here. You can grab the controller. Oh, sorry. I can't see you. You can just press quit. This one. With this one. Okay. So, quit. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah. And then, the bar, there should be a U. Hit the U. We know about this box, huh? Hmm. Tell me when you're in the lobby. Yep. In the lobby. And then, tell me when he goes dark. Dark. Oh, can you break? You missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But, how do I get to see him as is? No, no. He misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second. Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm just going to buy a lot. I'm actually a lab's maker decision, but I'm going to get me a single fucking detail about you. Do you know the days we've held to see the world of the way he goes? Violet, that's not fair. No. No, look, Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... I'm going to have to pick this later. I hope you can arrive in the show. No, I'll. Yeah. Okay, here. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Bitch! Oh. Oh. Shit. Oh. Sorry, I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. Oh, I didn't hear you guys coming. Oh, I didn't hear you guys coming. Oh, I didn't hear you guys coming. Oh, I didn't hear you guys coming. Oh, I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear of that? I would say most of it. Probably all of it. I know, I know it didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not smacking, you know? Some interesting how we hold on to memories is sometimes... I wonder if we can ever really capture everything we want to relax. Yeah, I'm trying to... to be a good father. Hey. To make it work with pretty shitty situations. I don't see all either of them. You know. Especially with toy and all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventional. But by the time I just went to see it like that, I think. Did everything about the time it was an ode to the yon thing? He loved it. The only handkerchief that showed... There was no last minute that figured what the hell... I'll take him with me. He never been to the US. Because I all his Christmas is came once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swabs for the big bands that like the concept of... ex-considit. But I knew he'd have some downtime. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We've explored the city. Hmm? I think we're in for a bit. I took him to sleep there more until the mat top. Of course I take his nap here. Not there. There's two things that's also there. It's still a blade for shows. It was human drug in the outbending. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love when you and I met his father. And we didn't have much of relations if I could relate. But I want to know what he needs to be. I don't know what he needs to be. It's memory that he looks upon a body. Not just the rock star father that's never there. After the time I think that's all that they are. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? It could be something simple or something profound. Just something that sticks with you. Well, my son, I'd want to remember my son. Well, I see kids as being quite individual. Reminding us of what really matters doesn't it? Those little eyes looking up at you, filled with curious things on the planet. They challenge us to be better and to hold on to every moment. Please. Please don't. I can't. Please. Just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please. Just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. She's gone. Troic decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You believe they're an idiot. You never let them see. They. Do. They. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. Seems to be only me that's getting older. Oh. You just missed our time. You just missed our time. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read a lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. Or in the bedroom floor. Or all the drawers. Or in the sofa. Or maybe under the table. And how about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. Oh. Oh, yeah, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Good. I've been writing my memoirs. Difficult because I'm losing everything. Things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play it. Oh, that was scary. Oh. I am aware. I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. Like recordings of what they remember. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. Oh my god, this is so embarrassing. But here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But when I rushed into the restaurant and you worked there. And I started to worry that you might actually have stuff me up. I mean, when it met you at your gig, you seemed like this impossibly cool young guy. So the idea of you ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. I couldn't just rain in a tent. And then finally, this young man bussles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. And it was funny. Because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, this is because of who you are, Chris. Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously. But well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. And I was touched by it. I had this complete stranger who'd seemed so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, everything with water and sweat was only a word of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know immediately how to respond. But you'd already started talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me. Sheptid. It was like peeking behind a curtain of something. We just met. There was such openness about it. We felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely and afraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation was said, waited to a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck and Chris. Because it's extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. On my other first date, I was showing you only an involved small talk. And I remember thinking, oh my god, there's such bravery to the sky. And then I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then I think, I think at that point, you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying that I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And yeah, I was just completely a consequential stuff. And you just... listen, like you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted to meet you. Like the house, the garden, the child, like getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for dinner. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, my god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she hasn't lost her wallet as well? No, please. This was my first date. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, please, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. And by you are a fool. Gino? Got such a... These guys said she's lost his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And any minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. I don't know where I went. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Oh yeah. Is that how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a daily cobbler, huh? I didn't realize we have a staff. They had a cop with you there. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet, then well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So where did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. So it's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pavish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or probably not to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your heart. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Calling Geno Key like it's plated, gold and post-cato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You tried to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you. Can't repeat, you twitch, you grin. You check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promised to return, babe, given a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Did you hear that? I think you're not going to win. I don't know, did you. I can't. I'm in love with you. I'll leave you alone. I'm in love with you. I'll leave you alone. You, you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end, one wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty, no alibi, the music swells, the moment spins, you'd love to heart, nobody wins, so place your bet and hold that grin, the plates are stacked and soaks, you're saying you play a slick, but here's the twilight, the twist, one went too slow, one move you missed, now look at you all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light, forgot the stakes, she saw the same, she knows the fate, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try, you bow and blurt, you beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in, I pick all the many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls, but me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, tune the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the nights, I save you nocta, then I can count, from broken lines to per-second nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and this dare you brought your grin, your little show, but fill your meal, the same trace to the rate, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the king, del man, Jarra, I'm velvet, in a hurricane, the last bite, on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama, me, up in your plight. A laura strums, by a fancule, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got. Ok, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left or right, or we start here, the salt, everyone starts on this. What are we doing, season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long, hold it, let it's your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are now, you can move left or right whichever is closer, once that, only the object is hiding, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I lead, slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection, and we better hear it. Yeah, it's like Mickey Meephaw, he's a great friend enough, he testes big men all that answers, suspecting not what Nebraska, real under the radar. Slide, slide. Parli of tricks, huh? You firmly must be thrilled. You know this anymore, they're falling away, slide. You know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not either, which means this is your object. Slide. Oh, no. Oh, he's a spark in a velvet storm, snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked like you were going to try. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free, or everything. Burn yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me wouldn't go spending time with someone like me. And we walked outside. It was under the bed and the other sense it covered the streets, which was seen. This was the best day of my life. That's as far as it's gotten. Okay. Good. Great. A lot of work. A lot of work. A lot of work clothes. A lot of a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We still have another scene that goes after this. Wow. Okay. And then there's a lot of just clean-ups of things. Yeah. All the characters have been renewed. Yeah. Okay. And so now we're cleaning all the mode cap. Wow. Okay. So amazing. Okay, next week and then we're shooting that last scene in the middle of July. And yeah, everything is built on that scene. We're just missing the actual performance of the actor. Cool. When he's giving the uglogy for his father. Okay. Amazing. Yeah. So we're not too far. Right there. Yeah. Can you take this off? Yeah. So, yeah. We can see the end line of the whole thing. How long have you been on it now? So there's one year of research. Then from September of, well, from January of 2024. We solidify the story and opinion to be. And then we started our day for all the work flows that we wanted to use. Yeah. That got us all the way to September. Then in September, we kind of said, right, let's get this work flows correct. And so we, out of all the work flows that we tested, we said, let's grab this. It's about 50, 55 workflows that we need to use. Right. And so we kind of went through all of them to get them correct. Yeah. And then we started production in January. Wow. Amazing. So that's, yeah. Wow. And so you'll add in your final scene? Final scene, clean mocaps, exchange characters. Like that last video is, that's my first rough cut of that video. Oh, okay. There's still a lot of cleaning to do, a lot of syncing to that. Everything. Which is, it should be color gradients, some other bits that we're going to do into the video. And then some little graphics that we're going to put into it just to make that very fun. Great. This meant to be a little bit more. I really enjoyed exploring the room with the AR and seeing, you know, touching real things and looking at it was great. And this is obviously, this is a bit of a made up, the actual one in Lisbon is completely decked out. Amazing. And then we're going to put this book, the photographs and it's got about 100 little, you know, literally it's like going down an air hole at some times. You know, there's so many things that you can find. It's funny, because people haven't actually touched any of the drawings or the, his notebooks or things like that. No one's right, really, the Walkman, except for a couple of people. Okay. I very nearly played the guitar, but my finger was, yeah. The finger was obviously one, one we actually do it, like as a piece, no one be in your business. Sure, sure, sure. In a way, I understand it for that, but it is, you become very aware that you have something in you. Yeah, yeah. There's just a little bit of it that takes it. But I really enjoyed touching everything and playing with things and, yeah, looking at the windows and, yeah. Right. One more thing to do. Yeah. What two more things do before? Hi, how are you? Yeah. There's two more things to do. Sure. Yeah. Will I follow you? I've got the H1 in my pocket still. I just take the mic. Oh, yes. Do you have the hearthens for on as well? Yeah, I'm reading. You know, if you want to. Sure, I can change. I can change. This is so thick, I'll hold. So, hold at the moment. Okay. Yeah. And then, I'll just take it and just hold it.\n",

      " And we need to sees how it goes on your page.<|sk|> TREÊÄñ THE gef Creating us a bit Oh Dear God Yeah, just two, two seconds Merci Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up but we're eating out anyway. So I guess it doesn't matter now. What do you feel like eating? We can hit that new French place. Try some Italian. Grab some Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers. It sounds good. Italian food. Italian. Yes. I was thinking we could check out that new pasta bar downtown. I've been hearing great things about it. Plus we can catch some tunes on the way. I've got the latest Bon Jovi cassette in my walkman. You can meet up with your... You're going to be the first to know. But I think I might have landed that gig at the record store. They called me yesterday and said they want me to come in for a second interview. A second interview of what? The job at vinyl revival you remember. The one where I'd be working. Okay. So what do I know? It's a great opportunity and it would be awesome to be surrounded by musical day. Plus it's a foot in the door for maybe even working with some of my favorite bands someday. Shouldn't we get going? Don't want to be late for dinner. And Mike and Sarah are probably already waiting for us. Let's grab my jacket and head out. Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to sight at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumber. You know, for a moriacat. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the press she's under to get a current project completed. And as you need to trip her copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawned on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, standing there I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip Charlie Sheen types and two to eyeball me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the every fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stopped for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy and an alarm goes off. I'm screaming the front panel. It's low. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. That is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding. And no she goes full into Blair in the access to the so I was vomiting in like everywhere on the walls on the floors on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper is our sending alarm sounding. The staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little gumbers there with them. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling. Just smiling like she's thinking. See I knew and I asked hold that was it. They fired me on this. I mean it's just a job. But you know I really wanted out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression for once. Hey can you see my jacket out there on the couch? I don't think so. No but there's one here hanging. I see this one. I can't see it. What do you think? Very nice. Yes of course. You can go like this. You're perfect. Thanks man. I'm just a bit nervous about tonight.

I'm sorry but I didn't see anything Where are the beers? Can I open stuff? Just two seconds. Mm-hmm. You're the bad part about having an answering machine. That's just records forever. You should have some of the speed to watch. Ooh. Sorry about the mess. Mentally not before heading out. So what's the plan for food? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and grab some burgers? Chinese, Chinese would be good. Chinese is a bad warning. Last time I was there. What's been there for, uh, hope you're over-chopped, please. Don't put this on your tape. Don't put this on your tape. Whatever you do, don't put this on your tape. On my tape? What is the tape? Wow, Chinese sounds awesome. I didn't expect that. But I'm totally down for some delicious dumplings and fried rice. Oh, the tape. It's all about mixing up those killer tracks for the perfect vibe. Can't wait to see what's on it. I don't know unless there's anything else I can do. I can't wait to see what's on it. I don't understand. It's like when you create a playlist, but on a cassette, you know, a mix of your favorites. Oh, ooh. Just set the mood for the night. Okay, okay, okay. A tape. Music tape. Can you make me listen to your tape? No. This is the music. Can I just type in the line? Have fun. yeah Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm also stuck. Yeah. Okay. That's stuck. When you were talking to him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He got stuck. Give me one second. No problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a little bit of an issue. Sometimes if you speak at a very specific moment, what he's talking. Ah. You, um, I bugged this is the, yeah. So I need to let him finish. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

It's- Well honestly, ya know, yes just a who just don't drink on my beard just two seconds sorry about the mess i meant to clean up but we're eating out anyway it probably is not like it matters now so what do you feel like eating french, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers? Italian we're not going with the usual sauce mix alright this place says anything with that is called out, out, I ain't eating no alien you saw what happens when they fly back who? sorry i didn't hear what you said I think he blocked again yeah i think he's blocked he's blocked again he's blocked again yeah man he's good to see you i told you about that new job sorry oh i don't know what i said what's it called? little gumba fronmarica so there i am this morning little gumba summons me to her office and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed and as you need to try to pick up copies of the 40 different documents she's holding and then it dorms on me the gumba is sending me to the copier room i know it doesn't sound like much but this fucking machine man i swear it's there on my belittle gumba but just finding this thing is like an authoring quest it's like on the other side of the building the place is a total maze but i'm the new guy and i really want to make a good impression and i'm too god damn scared of little gumba to ask with directions so i just stop running from room to room standing that i know where i'm going but for the longest time a whole place looks exactly the same i charge up three fighter stairs and across and then up again and suddenly i realize i'm on the top floor it's the executive suite and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeball in me and i know i'm not supposed to ever even set but in the ivory fucking tower so i just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal but i know the copier room is in the basement so i get out of there i start dashing back down and i'm screaming at myself find the path, find the path like i'm indiana jones by this point you know at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit he's coming at him from all sides and i'm so gasped i stop for a water break i start thinking i can hear little gumba yelling from me back in the office so i'm freaking out and i run down into the right room in the basement and the jukebox is playing and joe storm is singing i'm all lost in the supermarket so of course i take that as some kind of sign from god that i'm fundamentally doomed but then somehow i i actually find it and i'm loading up other documents and lining the number down and i'm thinking screw you joe summer i am lost i'm gonna make it but then i press copy and then the alarm goes off screen in the front panel says low-ping so i fill it with ink i'm so desperate by this point i just start hammering the copy and over and over and over it's like i've killed it it makes the hideous grinding noises out and notes she goes full in the blur and the access to this so i was vomiting in like everywhere on the walls on the floors on the fucking ceiling and it's firing paper out it's our sendin alarm sounding and i start flushing from the offices to see what's happening and it's just me and it's all on the other side this screaming machine coveniting looking like our text in the swamp of sadness and little goombas there but she doesn't say anything she just stands there smiling smiling like she's thinking see i knew and i asked hold they fired me on this i mean it's just a job but you know just to knock mess up and make an impress with one hey he's not joking i think i have to knock out oh it's here the jacket is here the jacket is here what you'll do is you jacket what do you think beautiful could be short is there any possible university in which i square this to the date sure why not yes no response yes you really just gonna let me go out like this yeah it's good you have to understand it's important that i get this right tell me have you ever had a really bad first date never my first date with this girl was a total disaster that's why i'm going for this something neutral hopefully i'll actually look normal this time her name is Violet and i know one of the kids i like she's just really cool she's stone to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like across between broad shields and Jennifer Connelly and she's just really smart i was so late Lord knows how long she been waiting there i had to change after rehearsal i tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted so i missed the bus and ended up going to run there and it started raining on the way like thundering down so by the time i finally started the restaurant i don't know a cat that just crawled out the urinal and she's just sitting there still and i don't know obviously so i started to explain myself and she doesn't really tell anything she's just sitting there so still sort of like what's an age rent in rocky as nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is it makes me have a conversation even more so i'm just blabbering i mean you know what i'm like when i get anxious to be honest i can't even remember what i was saying i got my entire life story but i'm stopping for breath let alone and i've heard to get an edger raise and then oh jesus then i sort of realised that i'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed so i just thought i tried lying the mood by telling a joke and i literally just died on me and later when i'm ordering it's just a Italian place i say something dumb and she knocky or something equally ignorant and the weight is just staring at me like i'm a moron and she's just just laughing and so i figuring that's it i'm dead i'm done and i'm screaming at myself in my head you asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but probably because i've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it's fine because i let the opportunity speak and she just talks talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of a roaming from the ground up and just just fell down thinking my god this skill is a whole fucking cool and the rest of the day just passed in a flash until i was planning to pay and i insisted to take care of it because i regulate so why not at least to go to bathroom and i am about to deal with it when i realize i've left my wallet who already thinks i'm an asshole because of the whole deenocky game someone's over the major day and violets about to come back any second i'm convinced this guy has it against me so i've got no more dignity left to save right so i just fall onto my knees in front of them and i'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me cheese i even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and i must have looked so pathetic that the major d takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks my kin and i'm still on my knees in front of them so i have to make out like i'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering to the major d and so somehow i had to go to get out of it so surely i can't mess it up twice in a row can i? she's really special okay so i'm coming at such short notice i've got this this thing it's for violent she's got a birthday come up i just wanted to write her something something that expresses what she actually means to me and i just i can't get it on my path what you do when when you're mentally blocked maybe i just show you what i got i help her spell it in the middle i don't know i don't know where it's going i mean i like it but where is this leading sometimes i think i should just let this music go and get a proper job what my dad says i mean ha tell me how to do it you know tell you a friend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you i'm i just maybe i'm just no good at this maybe that's it this is the universe tell them you tell them just stop and do something different just alright let me try again what do you say is it good maybe this come on come play with me come on come play with me come on come on come play with me come on come on come on come on come on come on that's it keep going keep going that's the path i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm Here you go. See, there's B with these things. Will just put it on. I really wanted it to be more, but Violet lied to me because it was a really good question. And the words have given you your crush. Violet said about she's on the line so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know where it's going to be, but just joking about it stuff, but no. Violet came part of it, she's got a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in the night. My music is telling her about it, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes you know I belong enough to type me a person in to take care of Violet. Anyway, look, everything's great. Because it is. Orey, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life, every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, see you later. Always be a face-calling of ladies and small. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories for the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical, but it keeps safe from this part of their existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better to spell something that you know about whatever life. You know what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for me to go there. As soon as I'm around, I'm going to say. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that or that. I think it's going to work out. I don't really know what they are. It's very strong. It's sort of weird. But I spent 100 dollars. I remember this was my childhood. You know, things I've been on. It made me realize what some poor thing that we're in. You know, I'm not living in my system anymore. There she is. I'm not picking. She and I used to play this part. I kind of found my hand. This was the form I kind of thought. And I'm a high-flight. Well, I'm sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because in my hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave you open and leave behind. The come of the people. Live other lives. You're the kids, right? So, literally living in our imaginations of that, we'd invent whole kingdoms, drive into this castle. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. I've never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... Strange, I guess. There's the worst thing I've ever experienced doing. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity of time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at my age. What it means to try to do something that's that bad. I'm quite a good figure. Just help easier to lose something that you've got. I guess that's why I wanted to have something that I already. Something permanent. Etch and stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't it? Just a second. I guess he's in a little bit of a bit of a two-bombing. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. That is her. That is her. She's a little bit of a small big. Fine, I'm just a shared person. I'm not a shared person. No. I'm just a little bit of a stress all of a sudden. I'm not as a kid. I'm just a little bit of a stress all of a sudden. I'm not as a kid. I'm not as a shared person. I'm not as a shared person. I'm not a shared person. I'm not as a shared person. Sorry, I didn't, I didn't know you guys could make it. How much did you hear about it? Not much. I just heard a bit. Nothing could have good GGG if that wasn't on. It was really not prior to my end right then. I'm trying to be a good father and make it worth a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. Especially with Toriel all the time. I'm approaching it a little unconventional. Violet just makes a tea like that. Did I ever tell you about the time when the boys were young? No, we were loved. We only had a couple shows. It was though we last minute. I think it's about how I'll take them with me. I've never been to the US for that all its Christus has taken one. There were small shows that small acoustic swabs for the big bands that might be the concept of ex-clusivity. I knew we'd have some doubt. We spent all our time together. Me and him. We've spilled the city. And I can't believe that. I took him to the league the more and to the mat of course I took him to the nap day. I love that. It's been tough for some of the first. He stayed up late. He was giving me our bed in the morning. He wanted to go out with him. Do more and see more. I love when you are meant to the father. We didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to always hear what he used to mean. I wanted to have memory of the adults of my family. Not just the rock star father that was never there. I've never done anything that's all of the art. That's right. I'm spending all my chasing dreams. Trying to be bright. And making different ideas and such impact. They want to know. Just fucking etch it. You're insignificant. How could anything that you're doing actually leave a bar? I'm out of my mind to do it. With my music and everything that came with it. The success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. I think people talk about chasing me and doing like it. I rest in the bird. You're alive to end up making sense. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing. So the needs of the people are making great. You just end up trying and... And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it are pushing further and further away from the people you love. People believe in it. Illusion. It's alive. Like the... The perfect life that we look at me. I've failed the marriage. I've barely seen the sun. And I would become the father. With my parents separated. I thought it was all I had fallen. That's the last thing that I want more into here. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to know the most important thing in my world. Sorry. Sorry, I'm just frustrated. I took inspired, possibly, a close pilot went through the fucking road. But she's only within three months. I was twenty years old. I was told that I was married. I thought I'd give it to you so we'll meet in front of the phone. I'll stay a month for the next day. Why couldn't I make it look really cool? No? How you love a woman? How are you? Please. No, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember it. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Correct decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. But of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You play the ring idiot. You never let them see. Thing. That is. That is. Sorry, I have a meeting and I thought so you know how long this is going to last more? Yeah, yeah, I wasn't the other room. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed all the time. You just missed all the time. It was just here. It was helping me trying to find. It was just here. You must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. It's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. There definitely isn't here. I'm certain of it. I just don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. All the drawers. Or a sofa. Or maybe on the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. I've been writing my memoirs. I'm losing everything. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in chorus? That was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkest thing. I'm just talking because she said you have a meeting in 15 years. I'm so sorry. We'll be enough for you to finish everything. Yes, my foot is over there. I'll take the chest strap. It's over here. Can you pass the handstand number one please? Yes, I'm going to take the chest strap. I'm going to take the chest strap.\n",

      " a window and a bookshelf. Once you say, that's correct, I'll get the hell out of the room. A couple of extra things to be aware of is, at some point, you're going to get asked to move from this room to that room. If it's not clear, don't worry. I'm watching you so I can say, now I'll go to the other room, but hopefully you do be able to move yourself out of this room. When you're spoken to, speak at this level. Okay. Always let him finish before you speak. It's just a bug that exists, and so, generally, we have to do that one. Number three, we reward people that are looking around and doing things, and so you're allowed to touch, interact with everything, eat, drink, whatever you find, you are free roaming for that. Maybe I should go off now. You can give it in. Yeah, maybe we'll have some luck in our work. I'll put it over there with you. So, when it's tight, when you get, you can tie it. There you go. I can re-tie this truck with you. There you go. Hey, that good? Yeah, yeah, good. Cool. Let's see. Now that you can see, something in the door. Yes. A window? Yeah. A window that I'm adding again? Yeah. And the portion in the room? Except that. My tree doesn't come. Now, take your little puppy and help. You know the old crowd, but remember, if they feel we could call those months in a while, I might kill the badger, if you're a Christmas. If you would love you, or one more baby, can you remember to bring that baby? Yeah, you can. The one that made you a lot of love. Thanks. I want a new dog. One that likes to eat cheese. One that's very well groomed. Doesn't have too many. Yeah, if you know the drill, make us know how to identify whatever. Just a drink on my feet. And they kind of follow the path. That's a good thing. Bigger. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. I'm sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but I guess we're eating out anyway. So what's it going to be? French Italian, Chinese, or Chinese or Chinese? I'm going to eat it out. What's the best thing you can eat for lunch? I can't eat it out. I'm going to eat it out. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but I guess we're eating out anyway. So what's it going to be? French Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? I think we should build for a burger. Yes, burgers. Honestly, why even pretend we're going to pick anything else? That's cool. Wow, I can't believe we're actually going for burgers. That's a solid choice. I can't go wrong with a classic. So where is the burger? There's this great place just down the street. They have the best fries and the juiciest patties. It'll be a fun spot to hang out and catch up. It's cool. I love that you're on board. It's always a blast to try new places. And nothing beats a good burger and some laughs with friends. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just a sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumba is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gum scared of little gumba to us with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. And the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types, and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. And I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumba yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm as singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it. And I'm loading up with a document, and I'm lining the number down, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost, I'm gonna make it, and then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy, and over and over and over, and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full-wimmed of Blair in the Existist. It sounds horrible to me, like everywhere, on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, it's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, looking like our text in the swan to sadness, and little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to not mess up and make an impression of you for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I just want to make sure I don't leave it behind. So, what do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? What do you mean? I really hope I didn't forget it. I always seem to misplace things. It's like my brain is always running a mile a minute. Is the silence because I look like a backup dancer for Janneau Jackson. Be honest. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Viola, and I met her on the gay tech plate. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So, I'll tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus, and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really dare anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... What's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incognizate even more. So, I'm just blowering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticising storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow, that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get in word in edge rays, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, try to lie in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, God, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... G. Nokia or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... just heart-slapping. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but... fuck it up with the very first junction. Why's wrong with you? But... probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second, it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about... architecture and her creative intent when she's designing, and... the music she likes, and... her dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell-bound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... passed in a flash, and... until it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so... why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise... I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole G. Nokia gate, someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me, so... I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And... I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And... I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks by kin, and... I'm still on my knees in front of them, so... I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major D. And so... somehow... I had to even have to get out of it. So... surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's... really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and... I just wanted to write her something. Something that... expresses what she actually means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What do you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or... husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... maybe I'm just not good at this? Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to step and do something different. Maybe I just... Come on. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Keep going. Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting our eat to bed. There's poison so speed up. And, the bottle is cold, which our Princess William and Prel Fortnite company Hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but Violet and I have become pretty militant of our sleep training and going to begin with and then you got crushed. Violet sends a lot, she's on the line so she won't be able to join us and I know I know worse her server. We're just juggling a bit of stuff and then Violet came part and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always birthed those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't read up memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical for Ari. It keepsake from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know about whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd know and that I think it'd be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So grab a pen, slip a paper, you can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and who they came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ari and remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He with Ari reminds me of being with my sister, but there she is. I'm not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest behind our family home. This was before my parents got up. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there we leave aching and the and the need behind and become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles and because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something but that day clarified it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something in the I guess that's why I want to have something for all right. Something permanent. Etching to stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, can you see? Just a sec. I'll go see you too. Maybe you can meet him. He's into you from day. Hi, hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, can you break? Mr. Day's. It's not a big violet. It's shared custody. He misses a couple days off school because I want to take him on top and spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been listening to yourself for a second. No, you don't understand violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking detail about you. Did you just say he's killed to see the world the way he gets? No. No, look by that violet. Listen to me. Look. You know all of this? We got to AhmadÊµÅË°å Œ≠œáŒµŒπ. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Let's be quick. Listen. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear of that? I'm about to go out. I guess that says it all. Wasn't it? I'm probably sounding like a message. I just, you know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to be a good father and to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially Victorian all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just went to hear like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took origin to York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US because I all his Christmas's came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We used to call the city and kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat to have court side tickets at the knap again. I loved it. It's dream-famous, does also have the ferv. and we stayed up late, the shows, but it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship I feel left, but I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly, not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing that you would never want to forget? It's fascinating how memories shape us, isn't it? I'll say it again. What I mean is there are moments you know that stay with you forever. They define who we are in a way. I see, I cannot tell you that. It's all right. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint those things, but it's the little fragments of time that can really hold so much weight. Tell you about the time I should have thought I eat in New York. Please. No, please, please don't, I can't. Please, just for a moment, I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot, you blithering idiot, you never let them see. They... do. They. No, don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Safer. It's safer there. Where do I go? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ari, here. You just missed Ari, he was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... I'm certain, they're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or... Or in the cupboard, I found them there before. Or the drawers? Yeah, the nice one, the nice. I'm hoping you'll give them. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table? How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant? Or... I'm so sorry, I've become so forgetful. They're just... Oh, oh, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've goodmixed me. I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult, and I'm losing everything, things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forrest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. Oh... I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is own barricade. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990, and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late, but then I rushed into the restaurant, and you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was possibly cool, young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me did it feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that, the big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny, because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late, and although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late, and that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry, and I'm Chris. I thought I was... I was touchified. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know, I didn't know we immediately had a response. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there, shifting. It was... it was like he gave behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such an openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first days have usually only involved in small talk. Um... yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then, I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really... I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. So then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds... it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I don't really know, I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. And I swear... What about your lady friend? No, please. This was her first day, and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom, so if she comes back here, this... She'll think of my fool. Please. Are you out of fool? What's wrong? He says the message won't. It's true, and my day is going to come back here, and then you're in it, so please just get me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. What's with you going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm just going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperfield, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I'd have to stop. Maybe God will reveal you. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go up to lose at this point? La Bain√©. La Bain√©. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or bright enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong... What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold calling Genokey like it's plated gold and proskato pizza, lands with flair, a nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose, cool and clean and easy.

      " A couple of things. Obviously there's going to be some glitches on motion captures and things like that. We know that. That's where I get cleaned up. Number two is when spoken to, speak at kind of a good level. I don't need to shout, but you can't be like this. You know, because otherwise you won't hear you. Please always let him finish his phrase before you speak, because there's a little bug that we're trying to fix. At a certain point you're going to move from this room to that room. If it doesn't make sense, don't worry. You know when to move, but hopefully it will make sense to you. When we start, I'm going to be here with you just to check that you see a door, a window or part of a window, a window and a bookshelf. Then the last thing is the piece rewards people who look around. So basically you can interact with just about everything. Whatever you see, you can grab it. You can try to grab it. Is it VR or an MRI? If you want to eat something, if you want to drink something. The entire place is off limits. Okay. Is it MRI or VR? Okay. Is it actually eating the thing or eating the thing? But let's see. All right. Yeah? You're good? So you should be in the lobby? Lobby main. No, it's the Lobby main limbo. And yeah, I see the boundary is now. Now it's gone. Now tell me to you, right? Do you see the door? Yeah, it's a door. Yeah, it's a window. A window behind you? Yeah, and a shelf. Yes. Enjoy. Actually, no, it's not. As you open the publishing house, you know, for all the crowds, but remember, you stay still. You just hold on once in a while. You can't quite kill the bad if you're a creeper. Just take it a shower. Just don't drink on my beer. Lobby. Just two seconds. Yeah. Hold you. Oh, Nick, I'll hold you. Oh, there's a fire. I want to see. Sorry about the noise. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out in the lobby. Right? So what do you feel like when you're a friend? Or just slum it. Chinese sounds are nice. Sick. I'm totally down for that. There's this new place downtown that's supposed to have amazing current house chicken. We should check it out. Have you heard about it? For sure. I've been wanting to try it out. I've been listening to this awesome mixtape on my Walkman all morning. It's got some great tracks that'll get us pumped up for lunch. I haven't heard about it at least. No worries, dude. It's a new spot. Just opened up last week. My friend Mike told me about it. He said it's the bomb. We'll have to check the reviews when we get there. Cool. Let's dry it out. Sure, let's dry it. Let's roll. I'm starving. And don't worry. My news can wait till we're all sitting down. It's not every day we get to hang out like this. Right? Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. She's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of, you know, a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front Maria got. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copy of room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man. I swear, Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an authoritarian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, in the places of total lays. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs and across and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeballing me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy of room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I press copy and an alarm goes off. Screen in the front panel says. No. So I fill it with ink. I'm so desperate at this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was harming to an ink like everywhere on the balls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. I was sending an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine. Coventing looking like bar text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. I know I was hold. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted, I don't know. I don't know. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Just see my jacket out there. I could have sworn I left it on the couch. I don't see any jacket. Is this, no. No jacket here. Hey, dude. What do you think? About what your looks. That looks quite terrible, man. Yeah. I guess this outfit screams. Dude, who works at Fort Blaster all that? Yeah, I read it right there. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was... That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Byler. And I met her one day gay type, and she's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect, and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between Brooke Shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. So they tell you about what happened on the first date. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jam myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going into fun there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incognizate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I extort my name and I planned for it and somehow I'll just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hear it to get a word in age raised. And then, oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just, oh, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just, it's just her laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool to me. Just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. I'm just as wrong with you. But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It's fine because Violet the opportunity to speak, as she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land she can sign a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell bound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So why not at least to go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky guy summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on my cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks back in and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major D. And so... I don't know how... I had too much to get out of it. So... Surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this... This thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she has for her dreams to be. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What you do when... when you're mentally blocked... maybe I'll just show you what I've got. Mooooooow... I have this melody in my mouth. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean... Faaaah! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell me a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... to stop and do something different. I'm just... ahhh... I'm gonna try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come back with me. Come on, I'm gonna be sad. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I hope you're okay. I hope you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. council I Okay nam is here I'm just putting on each bed. I'm just putting on each bed. I'm just putting on each bed. There's nothing you can use to fragile arms or stuff. We must not worry about the problem. That's when the mattressunda is fixed. Yes, you're right. Sorry about that. I really wanted it to meet you all, but Violet and I have a completely militant of our sleep training and the words of Gimli that are your crush. Violet sends a love, she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know we're so jealous of her, we're just joking a bit of stuff in the night. Violet came partner and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes you don't have long enough to tag me up person in to take care of Ori. Anyway, look, everything's great, because Ori, he's amazing, he's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea, I wanted you to, well, see a bit of a favor. I always burst those coming up legs this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create some of my physical part. It keeps safe from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know about whatever life. You know what you know now or what you wish you'd know that. I think it would be really cool for me to tell that. See you was around the whole thing. So, Robert Penn, I slipped the paper, you can pin them on that board there. It's like you've been doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are doing. He's sort of weird. When I spend time with Ori, I remember seeing him from my childhood. Things like the God. It made me realize what it's a full thing memory is. He was already, he runs me being with my sister, but there she is. She and I used to play this for us behind our family house. This was before my parents part. That place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there we leave the aching and the people behind, become other people, live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations on that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, drive in these castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that though, kind of hiding completely. Just how easy it is to lose something in your life. I guess that's why I want to have something for our own. Something permanent. Etching stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't it? Just to sit. I'll go see to them. Maybe you meet him. Hi, hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. I can see you. I did a break. Yeah, I did. The first thing is not an end chord. Let me just quit you really quickly. You just press quit. Yeah, let me know what everyone just quit. Yeah, no, it's not. Oh, no, it's back. And now, um, hit the U button. The U, uh, unreeling. Yeah. No indication. I use something. Something. Are you in the lobby? No, I don't know. It's the TXR 55 thing. Oh, it says not responding. Close app. Close app. Yeah. Okay, I closed it. Try again. Try again. Okay, now then, where the engine comes up? There's something in there that we don't know yet. Exactly what it is that sometimes it's just unanchors itself. Mm-hmm. Now I'm in the lobby. You see the piano again? Mm-hmm. Yes. Yep. About a corner can get the seed. Move. Don't identify with numbers, explains to Okay, yeah, yeah, that's time. Speak. Listen. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't, I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? I heard enough, but no worries. That's good to hear, you know. Sometimes it's nice just to share thoughts without overthinking. Thank you, thank you. Life can be a little overwhelming. I don't expect anyone to have all the... I don't think I like to find in it. Things are just, you know, messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally, but... Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows, and... it was very last minute, but... I figured what the hell... I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. And Erwin's small shows, small, acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of... exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And Keck Kareen food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more, and... and to the mat of course I think it's at the naft here. I loved it. Distinguished, I still don't think. I stayed up late, the shows, but... it was him dragging me out of bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more, and see more. And Erwin, you, I meant to my father. And... we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want Erwin to know what he needs to mean. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. I have the time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. What's the one thing you would never want to forget? In this ever-changing world, I think it's those moments that truly define us, you know. You know, I get it. It's a comforting thought, isn't it? To hold onto the pieces that make life rich. I believe that's how we build our stories, one memory at a time. Yeah, each has its own story. Yes, exactly. Every single moment has its own weight, its own melody. It's like a song that lingers in the air, reminding us of who we are and where we've been. True. I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in New York. Yes. The journey of life. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where do I go? Where? She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. And of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Heh. Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I hear. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. Oh, look. The same age. Seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Aurene. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? Sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or... or in the cabinet. I found them now before. Well, all the drawers? Or the sofa? Or maybe under the table? How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano? Or the plant? Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness to me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister and the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me boister notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. And then... I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this wasn't possibly cool, young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest... Hmm, I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. I just... Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem... I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now... dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I... I know. I didn't know we immediately had a response. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding a meter. Shifting. It was... It wasn't thinking behind the curtain of somewhere. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... Thumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know. All my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to the sky. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. There wasn't really... I don't know. It wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely unconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds... It sounds a little corny, but by the start... I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay, and I swear... What about your lady, friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first day, and I was really late, and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of a fool. Please. But you are a fool. Gina! Got such a... He says that I should run it. It's true, and my day is going to come back here, and then you may not be able to come back tomorrow. I swear to God, I'll come back tomorrow and settle it. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware one. Or this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? I think that's going to cover a tree-close meal. And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm not sure you're going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Maybe I could review him. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet, and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why don't you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. Or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strums. What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's played at gold. And Prosecutor Pizza lands with flair. A nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch. You grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You think you're close. You're still page one. You're still page one. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. You're still page one. You're still page one. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move. One mist reply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet. And hold that grin. The plates are stacked. And soaks your sin. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink. Two slow. One move. You missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table. Turn the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the nights. I save you, nocta, then I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And a stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your meal. The same trash to beret. You played your part. I won't deny but you can't trick the kindell man. Jaram Velvet. In a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama Mia. In your plight. A Laura Strong's. By a fanciful. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left or right. We'll start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck. Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are. And now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? He's had more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. I would better hear. Yeah, like me. Me. It's crack-benting now. Test band. Although horn season, not working Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Slide. Pilot Tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah. You can't rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not under salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. My own arm. Oh, give me a hug. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you put the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out. You were smiling and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. So you read in yellow sunset cover the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. That's it. That's quite a lot of things. Quite a lot already. Nice. You're thinking. You're thinking. Wow. The entire last scene. It's a film. It's a film. It's a film. So you got it. Okay. So that's it. And then we can.\n",

You know, we're all friends, but we're meant to stay. We're all about wanting to live. Come like you, we're all about it, you're a great place. Meet you with us, you. Oh, one more thing. Can you remember the competition we had in time? The one that made you laugh, though. Nice. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beard. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Take a nap. Let me be the... What's going on here, man? What's going on here? Let's read. Just two seconds. I'm sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway, right? So, what do you feel like having French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Italian. Italian. Ooh, you're speaking my language. Bring on the pizza, Diavola. I'm ready for it. I'm going to go to the restaurant. I'm going to go to the restaurant. I'm going to go to the restaurant. I'm going to go to the restaurant. I'm going to go to the restaurant. Diavola. I'm ready for it. Sure. There's that new pasta place downtown. We could try that. I've been hearing great things about it. Okay, let's go. Let me just grab my jacket. And by the way, I have some news to share with you. But let's get out of here first. Okay, sure. Let's go. So, shall we walk or take the bus? It's not that far, and it's a nice day out. Let's walk them. Cool. We can listen to some tunes on my walkman while we stroll. I've got the new Bon Jovi cassette. Which album is it? I'll be with you. I had such a terrible day. I was just worried about that new job. Sorry, internship. Are the publishing house? Okay. Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. So, I'm sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, for a moriacat. So, there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear Sarah might be a little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gunned scared of little gumbered to ask for directions. I'm running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types, and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So, I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. And I'm just sitting in the basement. So, I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office. So, I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. I'm just rummaging, I'm all lost in the supermarket. So, of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow, I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number dials, and I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Summer. I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. And the screen on the front panel says, no ink. So, I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous, grinding noise inside. And no one should go as full of the blur in the access system. So, I was harming it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I'll send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from the offices to see what's happening, and me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like artics in the swan to sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there, smiling at me. Smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They've heard me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, either way. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Hey, can you do me a quick favour? Can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the couch. Yeah. Yeah, watch out for the jackets. It's in the chair. What do you think? Cool. Which date? You know, the one tonight, I'm getting a little nervous. Well, it looked fine. Thanks, man, I appreciate it. I just don't want to mess things up. You're not saying anything. That probably mean that looked too good, and your chance of my staff. But, you have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Oh, yeah. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Yeah, you'll look fine. Her name's by there, and I met her one day to get her played. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like... ...across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just... ...very smart. So, they'll tell you about what happened on the first date. Yeah. Come on. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting, man. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus, and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... ...I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... ...what's an age-ren? In Rocky? It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation, even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how... ...crisisic storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath, let alone allow her to get in word in age-raising then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking non-stop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke, and just... ...oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some... ...Gee-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...hots laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole! You did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but... ...fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But... ...probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak, and she just talks... ...talking about... ...architecture and... ...percreative intent when she's designing, and... ...the music she likes, and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can design a house of her own, ...from the ground up. I'm just... ...spell-bound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... ...past in a flash, and... ...till it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I regulate, so... ...while at least I go to bathroom, and I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter, who already thinks that I'm an asshole because of the whole... ...dunockey gate, summons over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now, and convince this guy has it against me. So, I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and... ...any other possession to have on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just, for the love of God, cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And... ...I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me, and agrees just as Violet walks back in, and... ...I'm still on my knees in front of them, so... ...I have to make out like I'm... ...tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. ...to the major day. And so... ...somehow... ...I had too much to get out of it. So... ...surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's... ...really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... ...I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and... ...I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. But what you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked... ...maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... ...Fuck! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell me a boyfriend or girlfriend or... ...has been my boyfriend. What actually means to you? Am I just... ...maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. Ah! I'm gonna try again. What do you think? It's a bit sad. Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, let me start. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting our eatabad. Yeah, go ahead. Hey. Don't say that. I really wanted him to meet you or... But... ... note that I'm pretty militant of our sleep-ch –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Äial. And we went over to present... ...there were some aquilo scenes in our appointment. and going to the game with him and got crushed. Violet sends a love, she's on third mind, so she won't be able to join us. And I know, I know, worse, her, or whatever. We're just joking a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it, and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Orri. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Orri, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for Orri. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know, about whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for a bit of Zelda, you know? See what was around him on either day. So, Robert Pan, I slipped the paper. You can pin them on that order. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where they are. Do you know who came from? It's sort of weird when I spend time with Orri. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He was Orri. He was only being with my sister, then. There she is. I'm not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents part. And that place was like, well, we saw sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind to come up with people, live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're actually living in our imaginations on that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carrying it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is late, isn't it? Just a sat. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet him. He's into a grumpy. Hi, hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you miss two days? It's not a big deal. I like this shared custody. But I want to get to see him as it. No, no. If he misses a couple days of school because I want to take him on tour and spend some quality time with my son, it's not actually the end of the week. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand, by the way. I'm actually allowed to make a decision. Money always ends up going on. You know, you need to see the world the way you guess. By the last one. No. No, look by that. By the way, listen to me. Look out. Look at how I'm speaking this later. I have people like, so no, I'll... Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you back. Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, the time. Speak. Fish. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How are you? How much? Did you hear about that? Well, quite a lot. So you're in Violet or separated? You're looking a bit worn out, my friend. What's been going on? Yeah. We are. It's been a tough few weeks. Well, if good, good, dude, if that was a knock. It was really not prior to way out right there. Things are just... You know. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. And... To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.A. that often. Well, almost the last time you saw him. Especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. But Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took the origin of York? Nope. He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. Because all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows. Small, acoustic swatts for the big bands. Like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down-crown. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. What did you do? Explored the city. And... I took into the sleep no more. And to the mat to have court side tickets at the nap. Who won? Loved it. It's too focused, I was also third. And we stayed up late with the shows. But it was him dragging me out bed in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. How old is he now? I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks confounding. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After the time I think that's all that we are. I'm very... And spend your whole life chasing your dreams. Trying to do right for people and make a difference. But no idea if it's having impact on them or if they want it to. And bam! You're insignificant. Now, how could anything that you're doing actually leave a mark? No, I tried to do it with my music and everything that came with it. The success, the money, the fame and the family just to be happy. And people talk about chasing a dream like it. A recipe for your life to end up making sense. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing to ease all the pain to make you grace just ends up amplifying it. And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it just push you further and further away from the people that you love. People believe in this illusion. It's alive. This idea of a perfect life. And he look at me. I've failed the marriage. I barely see my son. And I've become the father. When my parents separated, I thought it was all my fault. And that's the last thing that I want Ory to feel. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to know the most important thing in my world. Sorry. Sorry, I'm just frustrated. I took inspiration so I can cause violent went through the fucking road. But she's going to be with him for three months. Because I'm touring Europe and North America's stadiums. We've got to do interviews and all of them meet the fans bullshit. I'm just going to get back from Spirits there. Why can't you make it work for me for once? You know? I'll tell you about the time I took Aureith and York. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where, though? Where? She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I hear. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. There's no one. You're just getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinet. Or in the door. Or all the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. I can't see them. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the piano. Or the piano. Oh, I'm so sorry. I've become so forgetful. They're just... Oh, see that isn't embarrassing. I've had them all time in my pocket. Oh, goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Yeah, you did. That was scary. Or... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Or... I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, is this an embarrassing? There it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... Yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. And then I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was possibly cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm honest... I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I thought I was... I was touch-fired. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know I didn't know immediately how to respond. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there. Shifting. It was... It wasn't peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such an openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... Don't struck a Chris. It's just extreme you're aware that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually been involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, oh my god, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself and then I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, was it really made my attention? So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I got the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. I feel like I'm sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow and I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she had lots of water as well. No, please. This was her first day and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think I'm a fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know. Got such hair. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then you mean it? So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. I'm just saying I own it. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree cause meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, that's how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Let me go reveal him. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Pabish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, signorious and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. I'm not a troll and slick, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Geno key like it's played at gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile. Tripp on grace. You're trying to lead but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet now. Oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move. One mist reply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're saying you play a slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. You're a little bit more. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I said slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me? I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table. Tune the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the nights. I save punetay that I can count. From broken lines to prosekown nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But fill your me, you're the same trast of array. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama me in your plight. A Laura strones by a fancule. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the door. Now you can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, like me and me both. I'm not meant to know. Test band. Although orange is only a knock-off in Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Pollot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind the microwave last week. You know that this anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. Madon, na, ma. Giffigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, you're lying. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. I know, Brad and Yellow's sons had covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. What's it? That's as far as we have. Okay. Yeah. Good. You enjoy it? Yeah. It was really cool. It's like a... You can see the story of a person. Right. Right. He himself, but not only. Yeah. In the last part. The thing that the Violet experience was so different from his own. She actually loved the day. She probably was a disaster first date. So that entire scene is actually going to be a film. Yeah. Right now it's just playing swadders. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can assume this is still the working progress, but it's still really cool. The scene, the top of the table, the day was really cool. Yeah. I think that's everyone's favorite. In fact, the painting is so changing. The story is all over the place. Yes, it's like that. So we're doing an archive.\n",

      " here. So you're going to be now outside and then walked into this place but you know we are where we are. Couple of things. When we start I'm going to be in the room with you and you're going to tell me if you see a window or a partial window, a door, a bookshelf and a window. If that's correct then I'll get out because that means it's sold with token. Okay. Second thing, when you're spoken to, when until you finish is talking before you speak and when you talk at this level. Okay. Okay. At some point you're going to have to go from this room to that room. If it doesn't become clear, don't worry. I'll be there to tell you to go to the next room. Hopefully you won't move by yourself. And then the third one, the last one is that in this experience we reward exploration. So anything you see, you can touch it, you can lick it, you can eat it, you can drink it, you can do whatever you want. Okay. There we go. Good. Nice and tight. Nice. Yes. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. What do you see? Now we see the green to the end a little bit more in. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Here we go. Now you should see the door. Yeah. I see the door. The window, the window, uh, the window, the window. Yeah. And the case. All right. I'll just read out his thumb. You never were all proud to remember that you did still need to hold on one to the line. I can't wait to hear all the bad news. You're in the middle of the evening. You were nothing. Oh, my mother's been here. Even that's a different message I just showed. I want to be in your arms, love. Thanks. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, try to call me whatever. Just enjoy drinking my beer. Take a drink. Take a drink. Take a mint. I'm a lady. Hello, Red. I know I really need to work with my heart for sure. Just two seconds. Hello. Hello. Sorry about the mess, dude. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway. So it doesn't matter. Right. So where do you want to go? French, Italian, Chinese, or just slum it and go for burgers? Let's... Something new, huh? Just kidding. I know we already decided on that new diner downtown. I'm starving. Let's get going. Do you want some eat? No, thanks, man. I'm good. We're going out to eat, remember? Besides, I had a huge breakfast this morning. Are you living here? Yeah, I'm living here. It's my place. I've been here for a few months now. It's a sweet spot. Close to everything. I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to the hospital. This spot. Close to everything. What town is it? It's LA, dude. The city of angels. I love it. There's always something going on. You can't get bored here. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day. I got fired. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of, sort of, sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her coat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear Sarah might be little gumber but just finding this thing is like an authoring quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gunned scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. And for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights of stairs and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the rat room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Stummer's singing. So I'm so lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I'm gonna press copy. And then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low ink. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start pouring the copy by an over and over. Hey! It's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous, grinding noise inside. And no one goes full under Blair in the access system. So I was vomiting in like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I'll send an alarm sounding. And the stuff I'm rushing from the office is to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine. Coving it in, looking like artics in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just, to knock myself in, making an impression of you once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Yeah, I see your jacket. Oh no, it's not a jacket. Hey. Woo! What do you think? You scared me. Hey. It's time for me to pick up a pen. I'm really sorry, Mr. Isaac. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day to get her flight. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect, and she's funny, beautiful, like, across between broad shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. But I'll tell you about what happened on the first date. But I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up having to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I started trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. I was sitting there so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an confidence rate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music in how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in age range. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's just Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... ...Gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the way it's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...start laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool. I just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes viral at the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and... ...the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. I'm thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate. So, while it leads to go to bathroom, I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole gene-knocky gate... ...sombs over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So, I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So, I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on my cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just put the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me... ...and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and... ...I'm still on my knees in front of them. So, I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. ...to the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had to mostly get out of it. So... ...should I cut myself twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and... ...I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. But what do you do when... ...when you're mentally brought? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody in mind. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a covered job, like my dad says. But... ...ha! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...just step and do something different. I mean, just... ...ha! And we'll try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. That's the path. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. What are you doing over there? Come here. Maybe that's it. Maybe I could get going too far. That's it. That's it. That's it. Hello? Sorry about that. How are you? I really wanted to meet you all. But... ...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really wanted to meet you all. But... ...by the end of the year I've come pretty militant about speed training. And going to the gym with them and got crushed. By the end of the month, she's on deadline, so she won't be up to join us. And I know... ...I know... ...worths, hoes, ever. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. By the end of the year, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were... ...like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But... ...sometimes... ...sometimes you don't have long enough to type the other person in to take care of Rory. Anyway... ...but everything's great. It is Rory. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...well... ...it's a bit of a favor. I always lived those kind of lives this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some in physical body. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better about something that you know. About whatever life. You know... ...what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for me to go there. You know? See it was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that board there. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and where they came from. It's sort of weird. I spend time at Aurel. I remember seeing from my childhood. You know, things like this on. It made me realize what a temple being in Aurel is. You with Aurel. The month we're being with my sister, maybe. There she is. She's a picture. She and I used to play this forest. I used to play this. This was the format of her. That place was like... Well, I saw it. Same pictures in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave you and Akin and Lily behind. And the come of the people. Live other life. Because you're the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castle. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... Straight, I guess. The worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young, and you have no real sense of consequence of your marriage. What it means to actually do something. But that's it. I'm trying to find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it in just stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the way to do. Just to say, I'll go see you too. Lily can meet her. He's into zombies. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, give me a break. Missed two days. It's not big. My life is shared custody. But how do I get to see her like this? No, no. I'm just going to see you. I'm going to see you. I'm going to see you. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like it's been. You just want to see yourself first. Yeah. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. No. No. No, look, Tyler. Tyler, look, I... You look like a person. I think you are. No, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bitch. Hey, how are you? Sorry. I didn't... Here you go. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go. Hey, how are you? Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, it's coming. How much? Did you hear it, but? Hey. Do you want to play something? Love that for me. Maybe next time you can just throw some smartos and put it go all the way. I think it's just... You know. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. Make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know. Especially with Torin all the time. Both. I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But by a little different teal like that. Did everything about the time I could always meet you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. It figured what the hell I'll take him with me. I've never been to the US, but that all his Christmas has came at once. And there were some small, small acoustic swaps for the big band that liked the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some down time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And kept Korean food for the first time. I took him to the flint no more and to the mat. Of course I took it to the nap thing. I loved it. Just think first, first. You see that light of the show. It was him dragging me out of bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I love when you I meant for father. You didn't have much of a relationship to have to do that. But I want to know what you've been doing. I want to know memories that he looks upon. It's not just the rock star father that was never there. I've just had a feeling that all of the are. You know, I was just thinking about that the other day. What's the one thing that you'll never want to forget my friend? Please. No, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They think. Do they. No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Ori. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... There definitely is here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or... I didn't. I don't see your glasses. All the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't see there in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. On the plant? Which plant? I'm so sorry, I have to come so forgetful. I don't find it. Oh, I see that. I've had them all time in my pocket. Good and straight. I've been writing my memoirs. It was just difficult. I'm losing everything. I've always did that. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That wasn't good. You told me, yeah? I am aware, I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me boys' notes. I've been recording of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkest thing. God, this is an embarrassing. Here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I actually ran in 15 minutes late. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was possibly cool, young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. We didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm cleanest, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally crushed it. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I thought I didn't know. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was he was only aware of me of how I might be seeing him. And I didn't know he didn't really have to respond. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there, and you're shifting. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such an openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, I felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I bought your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first days have usually only evolved in small dogs. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. So that is sort of talking to you about my work. And of a completely unconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. No, what about your lady, man? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please, this was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, please. She'll think I'm a fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know. Got such a... He says it as if you wanted. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here and then you mean it? So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Yeah. I'm not gonna play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah. Have you ever met a star? Yeah. Seriously, I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well. And clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love, baby. Love, baby. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Kavish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius. But why not to be dangerous? Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This throne's what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proskato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean. And you, your scribbles on a magazine. You flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You wanna read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill, no wallet. Now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And you're on dish-duty. No, alibi, the music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're sin, you play a slick. But here's the twist. One wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now, oh what a thrill. You're still a little bit more fun. One slow, one move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fate. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise it post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a more walk out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you no take. Then I can count from broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare you, brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your ne'o the same trash to beret. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama, ne'o, in your plight. A Laura strones by a fan crew. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show it. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. Or we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the door. Now you can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I leave. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we'd better hear. Yeah, like me, me, me. It's quite much in there. That's bad. Although I want season. No, I'll put Nebraska. We'll under the radar. Slide. Slide. Pala tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, it's not to rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That parts over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is not either. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Mad o'onama. Oh, give me a guard. Oh, he's the sparking up velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked. How you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. No. You're missing me. You're stopping me. What happened to you? What happened to you? Oh, I forgot to play. You were smiling when I asked you why.\n",

      " Yep yep I actually don't know how to go to the public account. You know we're all friends with the people who do still need to call their friends in a while. Can't wait to hear what they're doing here. You can come to the public. Just take it a shower. Thank you. You know the drill. Make yourself at home, grab a coffee, or whatever. Just don't drink. Take a nap. Take a nap. I want a new dog. Want a life to eat cheese. Walk in a... Walk in a... Walk in a... Walk in a... Walk in a... Walk in a... Walk in a... I'm really sorry about the mess. I meant to tidy up before heading out. I'm not eating out anyway. What sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it with burgers? School of burgers. Burgers it is. Sometimes you've got to embrace the grease and go all in. Pies aren't me. Wow, I didn't expect that. Burgers it is then. They're always a classic choice. But you don't like burgers? That's a solid pick. Burgers are fine. It's just surprising. I usually think of them as more casual. But sometimes the classics hit the spot. Don't they? Yeah. Sometimes the simplest things can be the most satisfying. Plus, you can't beat that feeling of sinking your teeth into a juicy burger, can you? You're right about that. So, absolutely. Just give me a sec to grab my jacket and we'll be good to go. I can't wait to dig into those burgers. Sharing sounds like a great idea. It's always more fun to enjoy a meal together and try a bit of everything, right? Yeah. You're right. There's something special about sharing food with friends. It makes the whole experience even better, like a mini celebration. Food tastes so much better when you share it. It's like creating memories with every bite, you know? Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Oh really? You got fired? Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariacart. So there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. Wow. It doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum-scared of little gumber to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensuit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with an idle and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back in the office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, and fundamentally do. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents, and I'm aligning the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. Screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And no, she goes full in the blur and the access to it. So I was harming it in ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out, it's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goomba's there with her. She doesn't take anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job, but, you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to knock mess up and make an impression of you for once. Can you see my jacket out there? Yeah. I'm kind of left it by the door. Yeah. I really want to make sure I have it before we head out. Yeah, it's over here. Call me to take it to you. Hello? Hello? You wanted the jacket? Oh. What do you think? Pretty good. It's snazzy. Any possible universe in which I should wear this to the day? I don't see why not. Sure. So, where do we go out? It's always the little thing, just to make sure I'm all set before we go. I'm getting there, just trying to make sure everything is in place. You know how it is. A bit of last-minute prep never heard. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me. Have you ever had a really bad first day? Oh. The first day with this girl was a total disaster. I want a new girl. One, I don't have the kid. Hopefully. One that... I met one that is very fondly accommodated. I met one that always will split it. Pretty cool. She's turned to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful. Like across between what she holds and Jennifer corner life. Yeah. And she's just very smart. Okay. So what's wrong? Hi, sweetie. It's not the game. I was just going through no boxes and get some like that. Lord knows how long she can wait. I had to change after rehearsal. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the box and ended up having to run now. And it started raining on the way, like thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a condensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious. To be honest, I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story but I'm not stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get a word in edge rays. And then... Oh Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke. And just... Oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some gnocchi or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool. And we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But... Probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gets violent the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about architecture and... her creative intent when she's designing and... the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. So... ...while it leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole... ...dinocky gate, someone's over the matur day. And while it's about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So... ...I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So... ...I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And... ...I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. Jeez, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And... ...I must have looked so pathetic that the matur D takes pity on me and agrees just as violent... ...what's back in. And I'm still on my knees in front of them so... ...I have to make out like I'm... ...tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. The matur D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had too much to get out of it. So... ...should I have messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Hey, so coming at such short notice. I just... ...I've got this... ...this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up and... ...I just wanted to write her something. That... ...expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on my path. What'd you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? What? Maybe I'd just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean... ...I don't know where it's going. A proper job, like my dad says. I mean... ...fuck! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or... ...husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...just stop and do something different. I mean, you shouldn't say that. That's why I got it. What do you think? Pretty good. Maybe this? Come on. Yeah, come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Yeah. What are you doing over there? Come here. Yeah, I think I'm just putting it all into bed. There's places where so speed up. And Israel So Hello? Hey, there you are. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all, but by the end of the day I am pretty militant about sleep training and going to the gym with them and got crushed. By the end of the month, she is on deadline so she won't be up for joyless. I know, I know, worse, her, sister, we are just joking about stuff at the moment. While it came part, she is under a lot of pressure. She and I were like ships in a night. My music is taking off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of R.E. Anyway, look, everything is great. Really, R.E. he is amazing. He is like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always burst those coming up late this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical about it. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you would mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for me to tell that. See what was around him on his face. So, grab a pen, slip the paper, and you can pin them on that board there. Cheers. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and where they came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time at R.E. I remember things from my childhood. It seems like it's forgotten. It made me realize what a tempore thing memory is. He was already, and must be of being with my sister, but there she is. Not pitching. She knows to play this forest behind a family home. This was the former parents' part. And that place was like, well, there's sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We can put whole kingdoms, drive-ins, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just...strange, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, and she felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carfiding completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of it. Something permanent. I get shit in the stone so it can't be lost, right? I agree. Oh, the master is away, isn't he? Just a sat. I'll go see to them. Maybe you meet him. He's in too bumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Is it over? No. I think it crashed though. What are you seeing? Forrest. Are you still in the stock? I just got for us. I didn't break the for us. I didn't break. Broke. Interesting. Because we have the same issue. Yeah, that's interesting. It happened to us in another... Playtest? With another headset, funny. Same issue. Yeah. Let me... You get my iPad. You pass me my iPad. Let me see if I can recoup it. Sure. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. You can't. I can't. You can't. Bye, Le. You should have said custody. But we want to get to see him as is. Good. Good. You're here again. See if it happens. If it happens again, then I have no idea why it's doing it. Yeah, that happened to us in another headset yesterday. And we thought it was just that headset. But there must be something that is making it. Okay, let me... I'm sure I like this. Okay. That's really odd. Give me a second. Let me restart the headset. There's something really, really fucking odd about this. And I still don't understand what it could be. Really crashing? Yeah, why are you crashing in that way? You want to... You want to... What are you doing over there? Come here. Okay, yeah. It broke. I have no idea why it let me. Yeah. Okay, yeah. It's done. Whatever you wanted. That's why. You keep being tracked over log or something? Yeah. It's like... It's forgotten the whole thing that we did on this set up. I'm going to have to redo this room really quickly. Sure. Yeah, basically forgot the entire scan that we had. I created everything weird. That's why... That's why it breaks. Is this tracking or is it tracking? Yeah. Two more shots. Flashed it. So it lost the tracking completely. So everything that we've made, it's gone. So there's something to note take there. Okay. Okay. Just a little push in here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Tell me if that... Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the time I'm putting the litter in the last eight days, I mean, the lines of gymnasium are crushed. By the time the mud, she's on the line. And coordinator, from here, when the lot started laying there. That's when the stuff went in, she'd want me to have a bunch of more and more. But it's exactly what I'm talking about right now. I know I know we're sorta seller but we're just dragging a bit of stuff online. Balu bitterying part on she's under a lot of pressure. But sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the unperson in to take care of all of it. Anyway, look, everything's great. Because it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, see a bit of the failure. I always burn those coming up late this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of my physical parts. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you've mind writing a message. And it can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool if I'm going to go there. Sure. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that boarder. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know what they are and their name from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time at all, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things like the dawn. It made me realize what a simple thing that we're in. You and I, it was only... It reminds me of being with my sister a minute. There she is. She's in a picture. She and I used to play this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents' part. And that place was like... Well, I saw it, saved continuous, in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the knee behind. And the come of the people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, drive-ins, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we really got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just... Straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something, but that place. I'm kind of glad it could be. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I wanted to have something that already. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't he? I guess he too. Maybe he came here, he's into a room there. I... I have a little buddy. That is him. That is him. Oh, give me a break. Should he find... ...shared... ...but I can hardly get to see it at this. No, no. He misses a couple days of school because I want to take them to him. I'm fine. I'm working with him. He's not missing. Don't understand why you have to allow me to see him. I'm running out of money and we still have fucking needs out by you. Judicial nature is killed to see the world the way he gets. But I don't love slow things. No, no, look by that. By that, listen to me. Look, I... ...I don't speak to you like that. I hope you do. Okay, got... gather time. Bitch. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... He does come in. Hello. How much did you hear about it? Almost everything. I heard almost everything. I know, I know. It didn't sound great. I'm not proud of it. But I smell it. Yeah. Divorced, right? And you know that was... ...things are just... ...you know. Yeah, I'm trying to... ...to be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Both. And I'm approaching it little and conventionally. But... ...by a little different teal I've had. Did I ever tell you about the time I could owe you your... ...he loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was though we last met. But... ...you could... ...what the hell? You never been to the US. That all his Christmas Eve came at once. And no one's more shows. More acoustic swaps for the big band. But like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downtime. We spent all that time together. Me and him. Sounds good. We explored the city. And we had Korean food for the first time. I took him to the sleep no more. And to the mat. Of course I take it to the nap today. Just beautiful. And we stayed up late to the shows. But it was him drugging me our bed in the morning. And he went out and then do more and see more. I love the new I meant for Father. And he didn't have much of a relationship actually left. But I want to know what he needs to be. I wanted to have memory, but it looks like I'm probably... ...not just the drop star part that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. Don't worry. I spend your whole life chasing you dreaming of it. Trying to do right for people and make a difference. There's no idea if it's actually impacting them or if they want it to and then bam! Just fucking hit us. You're insignificant. But how could anything that you're doing actually leave a mark? You know, I tried to do it with my music and everything that came with it. The success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. And people talk about chasing you dreaming of it. I recipe for your life to end up making sense. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing to ease all the pain and to make it great just ends up amplifying it. And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it just push it further and further away from the people that you love. People believe in it's illusion. It's alive. This idea of the perfect life and he's locked at me. I've failed the marriage. I've barely seen the sun and I've become the father. When my parents separated, I thought it was all my fault. And that's the last thing that I want already to hear. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to know this most important thing in my world. Sorry. Sorry, I'm just frustrated. Took inspired fossil again. The cold spider went through the fucking road. But she's gonna be within three months. I'm touring Europe and North America's stadiums. I've got to do interviews and all of the meat and fun and the bullshit. I think I'm back for the first time. Why can't make it work for me for once? You know? I'm just going to say something. I'll tell you about the family to go eat in your... Yeah, you told me. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where, though? Where? Oh, oh no. Oh, oh no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the past. You have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You look so well. You look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Auri. He was just here. He must have had to lead. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you there? Would you help me find them? Yeah, sure. They could be in the bookshelf. Or... Or in the cabinet. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about a chair? I think it... Not sure. I went to the home screen all of a sudden for some reason. They could be in the kitchen. I think it... Not sure. They could be in all of a sudden for some reason. Did it crash? Did you touch your fingers with this thing? Oh, probably. Should I...? Oh, did it? I was trying to interact with something. So good. The last part of it is just a placeholder, so you're good. But that's that's a funny one Yeah I don't know You\n",

      " There's a phone ringing. This is a matrix style entrance. All right. Do you see the door? Yeah. There's a window. The window is a little bit upwards, but I guess there. The window's there. And the bookshelf. Oh, okay. That's a job at the publishing house. You know, overall prayer, but remember, if you still need to call those months in a while, you can't wait to hear all about it. You're a Christmas. Meet you and love you. Or one more thing. Can you remember to register the show, though? The one that me and your aunt love. Okay. Thank you. You know the drill. Makers have at home, protocol field, whatever. Just a drink on my beer. Take me, take me, take me. Take me, take me. I'll be gone. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I really need to work on my white beach. Just a few seconds. Does this work here? Ah, okay. Oh. Man. It's like he's supposed to be on. Sorry about the mess. I really meant to clean up, but hey, we're eating out anyway. So, what sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Yeah, we can go for burgers. Don't we go, how did this go? It's so big, Joy. Let's go make some questionable choices with it. Wow, I didn't realize it could be confusing. Burgers are a classic choice, though. You can't go wrong with a juicy burger and some fries. That's wild. It would be so tricky to decide on something so simple. But hey, as long as there's good food and good company, it'll be a great time. Oh, shit. I'm going to have to go to the side. Oh, good. It's funny how this... Absolutely. Sometimes it's the little stuff that trips us up. But I'm excited to just enjoy some burgers and hang out. I'm excited to see this. I'm excited to see this. I'm excited to see this. Whoosh. Life can throw some curveballs sometimes, but hey, as long as we keep rolling a bit, those tasty burgers will make it all worthwhile. Can't get too good to see you, right? I'm in such a terrible day, I got fired. I told you about that new job, sorry, internship. It's what? A house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish, with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariacat. So there I am this morning, a little gumber summons me to a office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed, and how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me, but gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too got-gum scared of little gumber to ask with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming in from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from me back into office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing, and Joe Stummer's singing, I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up other documents and aligning the number dial, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low in. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. The boomer. She goes full into blur in the access system. So I was vomiting everywhere on the floors, on the fucking ceiling, and it's firing paper out, it's our sender, an alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like RTX in the swanther sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling at me, smiling like she's thinking, see I knew. I know I saw, that was it. But you know what I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Amazing. Just to knock myself and make an impression if you want. Brave New World. So what's next? I'm back. Can you see my jacket out there? I'm a bit worried I left it behind. Yeah, it is. You left it. So I'm back in the Brave New World. It's here on the chair. You left it on the chair, your jacket. Now the park said I could interact, but I can't interact. Unless... Oh, I'm not familiarized with this at all. And... What do you think? Looks great. Ugh, all of them. Why not? I'm sure it. I'm trying to interact. It's all about navigating those moments, really. Sometimes, we just have to take a deep breath. I'll remind yourself that it'll all work out in the relevant paper band. There's definitely a learning curve to all of this. You have to have the squad. Just gotta keep putting themselves out there. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Well, my first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... ...neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her one day at the game set. Hello, dear, is your mom... ...and just came back from the office, because she was me. You seem to be a real boy. Of course, that green brook here. Call me back. Maybe we could go together next time. It'll be a hoot. Love you. Did I tell you about what happened on the first date? Farad, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a bar of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I found this, I got into a car accident. I might need some help. I don't know. A car accident. Am I allowed to interact with the digital objects? I'm quite in sort of still, and I'm not saying yes. I'm actually obviously in sort of a car accident. So probably, I don't know how to do this. I'm okay. And also, I don't know if there's a glitch in the matrix, but there's parts of someone up in the corner. No, no, there's a foot, and there's one hand. I don't even remember what I was saying. Okay. I think I was running about my music and how precise I storm my name. To the table? Like, plans for it and so on. Oh, it is. It is. Put it out my entire life story, but I'll stop it for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in her dreams. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realize that I've been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just, oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. The way to just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is long with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by, let the opportunity to speak, and she just stops talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking good. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ride late, so while it leads to go to bathroom, and I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole gene knocking on someone's over the matri-day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me, so I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matri-day takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the matri-day. And so somehow... I had too much to get out of it. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. I read. Thanks for coming at such a short notice. I just... Hello. I've got this... this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just... I can't... get it on the path. What'd you do when... when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Why is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go. Get a proper job, what my dad says. I mean... F***! Tell me what to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you to... just stop and do something different. I mean, just... Ah! Let me try again. What do you think? Looks great. Maybe this? Keep going. Come on. Come play with me. Really? Come on, I'm not going to scare you. Come on, I'm not going to scare you. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. Ha ha ha ha. Oh shoot. Are there any shoes? I'm not going to scare you. I'm not going to scare you. I'm not going to scare you. Hmm? Hmm? Come on. What do you mean? Hmm? Hmm? All right. What do you mean? Um, but the next route? Yes. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on your bed. Whoa. This is me, yourself, is home. You want to see me? You want to see me? You want to see me? You want to see me? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. OK. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. like ships in the night. My music is taking off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Ori. Look, everything's great because it is Ori. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a fader. I always lived those coming up legs this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. I wanted to create some of my physical body. It keeps safe from this part of his existence. I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. What you know now or what you wish you'd know that, I think it would be really cool for when he's older. See it was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, slip the paper, you can pin them on that board there. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know why they are here. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Ori and remembering things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple thing memory is. He was Ori. He was being with my sister. There she is. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former parents part. And that place was like... Well... It was a little center. It was very kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there we'd leave the aching and the need behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations up there. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we got lost up there. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just...straged, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that back there. Carrying it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, isn't he? Just to set me. I'll go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him if he's into Brumby. But I...I have that little buddy. That is her. That is her. I'm just going to go see her. Can you pray? Missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But how do I get to see her like this? No, no. If he misses a couple days of school because I want to take one to him, I'm going to spend some time with my son. It's not at all. What do you mean? No good don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without money, but we still have fucking details about you. Two days of kill to see the world the way you guess. Right, I was just bad. It's pushed out of me. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look out. I'm going to have to speak this way tonight. I'll be the way I'm so. No, I'll be. Yeah. I'll tell you the English in the end. Yeah, that's fine. Speak up. Finish. Yeah, I'm finished with it. Come on, Violet. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't. No. How much did you hear about? Everything. Nothing. Could good, good, good, good, good. That was a not. It was really not prior to why I got back. Yeah. You know, you're doing it messy. Yeah, I'm trying to be a good father. Make it work in a pretty shitty situation. Really? Why is that? I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Can you follow me? Well, no. You can't. I'm approaching it a little unconventually. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin New York? No. He loved it. Really? We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but it figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. We never been to the US, because that all is Christmas. It came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. We had to get Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat. I caught sight tickets at the nap, seeing. Loved it. Just being first, was awesome first. And we stayed up late for the shows. But it was him drugging the arbeid in the morning, because he wanted to go out and then do more. And see more. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship, I feel like. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. And spend your whole life chasing your dreams. Trying to do right for people and make a difference. But no idea if it's having impact on them, or if they want it to, and then bam! Just fucking hit you. You're insignificant. No, how could anything that you're doing actually leave a mark? No, I tried to do it with my music and everything that came with it. No, the success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. And people talk about chasing a dream like a recipe for your life to end up making sense. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing to ease all the pain and to make it great just sends up amplifying it. And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it just push it further and further away from the people that you love. People believe in this illusion. It's alive. This idea of the perfect life. I mean, look at me. I failed the marriage. I barely see my son. And I would become the father. When my parents separated, I thought it was all my fault. And that's the last thing that I want Ori to feel. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to know the most important thing in my world. Sorry. I'm just frustrated. I took inspiration from the weekend and caused violent went through the fucking road. But she's going to be within three months. Because I'm torn Europe and North America's stadiums then. We've got to do interviews and all of them meet the fans, bullshit. I'm just going to get back for this birthday. Why couldn't make it work for me for once? I'll tell you about the climate I ate in New York. Please. No, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Oh, no. Oh, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. Don't let them. Come in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, laa. I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My god, you look so well. You all look the same age. seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ori, he was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here, I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets, and I found them there before. Or the drawers. There's another leak. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Nope, they're not, sorry. Or the plant? No, the plant. Oh, you forgot to water the plant, I guess. All the plants. Sorry, I've become so forgetful. Yeah, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Did you have them, Arthur? Good news, I'm... I've been writing my memoirs, which is difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Bylet the other day. It's the darnest thing. God, this is embarrassing. Here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed, yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... You just seem like this was possibly cool, young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a clenist... It was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I thought I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now... dripping with water and sweat. Was he was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I... I know. I didn't know we'd nearly had a risk on it. But... Yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like... You're holding me there. Shipped in. But it was... It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like you were completely unhappy to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got in your sister. Really? And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. How it destroyed you. And I was just... Thumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extreme we were. That anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first days have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, My God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and... Take your hand. But I wasn't random enough myself and then... I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And I was just listening. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but my dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Yeah, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. Nah, what about your lady friend? Sure, this year I've lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... She'll think of a fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know. What's that, chair? It's true. And my day's gonna come back here. And then in a minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have that policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Yeah, I'm not gonna play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. David got a view here. Seriously, I privit to you and leave you over the bracelet and well. And clearly you don't believe me anyway. So what did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior, yes, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll in sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You tried to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty, no alibi. The music swells, the moment spins, the moment's gone. You're the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. You're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply, and you're on dish-duty, no alibi. The music swells, the moment spins, you bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet, and hold that grin, the plates are stacked, and soaps your sin. You play it slick, but here's the twist, one wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light. Oh, she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, tune the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the nights, I save you nocta, then I can count. From broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and a stare you brought your grin. Your little show, but Phil you'll me, you're the same trash to beret, you played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the kingdom and you'll be. I'm velvet in a hurricane, the last bite on a porcelain plate, the whispered mama me up in your plight. A Laura strones by a fan crew, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great, show us what you got, yeah show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure. Bye. Okay... bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, lay down in line, left to right, or we start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look as too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it, no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. I would better hear. Yeah, like me and me. It's crack went to hell. Test band, although orange is on the north, working Nebraska. We'll answer the raider. Slide. Slide. Paolo tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Madonam. Oh, give me a guard. Slide. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Slide. All set. Slide. I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, you're lying. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. The red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares, the bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. Ready? Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ready. Man, this is the most I've been using a headset. How many do you think you were in there? Well, I looked twice at the watch show probably close to 50 minutes because I wasn't aware when we started. Are you taking it out? Because I don't know how it's going to be. So it was great. What's the purpose of this last set? I know. Of the screen, do you mean? Yeah. That's going to be a film. That's right now is just a placeholder. Oh, okay. Because it sort of looked like it was easy to keep it on for a long time. But it actually wasn't. I don't know if it was because you keep shifting like to right and bottom. I don't know if there's any kind of movement that causes you some kind of movement. Yeah. Thank you. Some kind of movement. Is it a step where you start to move forward? That thing is the thing that you do not have to do. That thing is the thing that you do not have to do. That's what I was thinking. That's what you're trying to manage.\n",

      " you can check that you have a door, a window, a window in a bookshelf. Yeah, that's good. So I know that you're in the right room. And then when you are spoken to, speak at this level. OK? Always let the person finish talking before you talk. OK? OK. At one moment, you're going to be asked to go from this room to that room. If it doesn't make sense, I'll be watching so I can tell you the other room. OK? And then the last thing is we reward people that investigate and move around. OK. Let's go. OK. Great. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Wait, wait. Is this the door? Yeah. The window? Yeah. The window? Yeah. OK. We'll leave your name, phone number, and who's that? I just want to get on here. I forgot it. I have to go with the topic in there. You know, we're all proud, but remember, you do feel useful when you're called out once in a while. Can't wait to hear what you're about if you're interested. We need you enough to use a phone number. You can manage it. You can manage it. Just take it a shower. You're welcome. Thank you. Take yourself a tone, radical, whatever. Just a drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. Take on me. I'll be gone. Hello, Dad. I know I really need to work on my high pitch. Just two seconds. Hey, yeah. Oh, that was close. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up. But since we're heading out anyway, what do you think sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Burger sounds great. Ah, the good old burger joint. Let's go and make some questionable choices with extra cheese and fries. Okay. Should we go? Wow, really? I didn't think burgers would be that popular today. It's kind of a surprise, but I'm all for it. Absolutely. I mean, why not? Burgers can be a real treat, especially with all the fun toppings and sides. That sounds like a plan. I can't wait to dive into those juicy burgers. They're such a classic comfort food, and it's always a blast to try out all the different combinations. Okay. What's your favorite combination? A good burger has to have some crispy bacon, melted cheese, and a drizzle of barbecue sauce. Toss in some jalapenos for a kick, and I'm in burger heaven. Wow, it looks like you read my mind. I would go for that. That's the dream combo right there. It's like an explosion of flavors in every bite. Man is good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. I'm also sorry to hear. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. She's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just as sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumba. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning, and little gumba summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get her current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. But gumba is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumba, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gulp gum scared of little gumba to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set foot in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing, and Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all last in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking, screw you, Joe Sturm. I am lost. I'm going to make it. But then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no ink. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into Blair and the access to this. So I was hobbitting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sendin' alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew, and I asked, hold, that was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I'm worried I might have left it somewhere. You're in a jacket, so I'll be sure. What do you think? Uh, looks good. Like the combo. Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? Why, why didn't you? You look fine. I appreciate that. But I just want to make sure everything's in order before heading out. It's a good idea. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'll be sure if I can do things in order before heading out. It's always the little things that trip me up, you know. Is the silence because I look like I'm back up dancer for Janet Jacks. To be honest. No, no, you look brave now. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me. Have you ever had a really bad first date? Oh, for sure. Who hasn't? My first date with this girl was... A total disaster. something neutral Hopefully I'll actually look normal this time Her name's by her and I met her one the gate played and she's just really cool She's stirring to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful like Across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly and she's just Really smart So they're talking about what happened on first date God I was so late Lord knows how long she been waiting there I Had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there and it started raining on the way like Thundering down so by the time I finally stagger into the restaurant I look like I don't know a cat that just called out the urinal and she's just sitting there quiet and Sort of still and I'm panicking obviously so I start trying to explain myself and she doesn't really do anything She's just sitting there so still sort of like a what's it a Adrian in Rocky as nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is It makes me have an compensate even more so I'm just blowering at her I mean you know what I'm like when I get anxious to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying I think I was running about my music and how Chriss Isaac stole my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath Let alone and I'll hurt to get a word in edge rays and then Oh Jesus Let us sort of realize that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just It just died on me and later when I'm ordering it's this Italian place I say something done asking for some G. Nockie or something equally ignorant and the waiters just staring at me like I'm a moron And she's just Hot laughing and so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head You asshole you did it again you actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first Junction why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second it finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just talks talking about Architecture and the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and How a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just Spellbound thinking my god this girl is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just Past in a flash and Tell it was planned to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late so Violet leads to go to bathroom and I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole G. Nockie gate someone's over the matredate and And Violet's about to come back any second now convinced this guy hasn't against me so I've gotten no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them and I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just If they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow and And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violet walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them So I have to make out like I'm Time my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major D and so somehow I Had to get out of it so Surely I can't mess up twice in a row can I? She's really special Thanks for coming at such short notice I just I've got this This thing It's for violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that Expresses what church remains to me and I just I can't get it on the path What you do when when you're mentally blocked Maybe I just show you what I've got I have this melody but I Know I don't know what's going I Mean I like it but Why is this leading Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says I mean Tell me all to do it You know tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just Maybe I'm just not good at this maybe that's it This is the universe tell me to just stop and do something different Try again What do you think? Maybe this Come on Come play with me Come on, don't be scared That's it that's it Keep going keep going that's the path You You You You You You What you doing over there Meet yourselves at home, I'm just putting our eat bad You Heyaud and Oh Yeah Hey. Sorry about that. All right. I'm not here yet. I'm going to go to bed. I'll just leave the room, and I'll go to bed now. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. I'm going to get up. Sorry about that. I really wanted him to meet you all, but Violet and I have become pretty militant of our sleep training and going to begin with him and you got crushed. Violet sends a love, she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse host ever. We're just struggling a bit of stuff at the moment. Violet came part of it and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously, but sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take her away. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Orey, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to...well, it's a bit of a favour. I always burst those coming up late to this mad. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for all of you. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. Whatever, life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for him when he's older. See what was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, a slipper paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where the idea came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time with Orey. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realise what a temporal thing memory is. He with Orey reminds me of being with my sister living. There she is. I'm not picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was before my parents died. And that place was like, well, we saw a sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind and become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we literally got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just to set. I'll go see two of them. Maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi, hi there, little buddy. That is here. That is here. Oh, give me a break. I missed two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as this. No, no. If he misses a couple days off school because I want to take him to a hospital in a quality time, my son, it's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Do you listen to yourself for a second, will you? No, you don't understand Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without wanting every single fucking thing you know. Do you think he's going to be killed to see the world the way he gets? Violet, last lot of that. No. No, look Violet. Violet, listen to me. Look, I... We're going to have to keep this later, I hope you can wait. So, no, I'll... Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's time. Speak. Bitch. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about that? Almost nothing. Oh, good. Violet and I... We've been through a lot. Some days it still feels like we're trying to figure it all out. Things are just... You know... Messy. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either often. You know, especially with Torian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time it's an old and new young? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and... It was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? It was taken with me. You'd never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. Erwin's small shows, small, acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. We explored the city. And... I took him to sleep no more, and to the mat. I have court side tickets at the nap, too. I loved it. The streamfamous does awesome, too. We stayed up late, the shows. But it was him dragging the hour bed in the morning, because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. I never knew what I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship I've really left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memories that he looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that we are. Memory. What's the one thing you would never want to forget? I think those moments that shape us, they're like pieces of a puzzle, right? Right? Sometimes it feels like if we lose just one piece, the whole picture changes. I wonder, how do we hold on to them? Well, you can't. If you lose one, you lose one, you move forward. It's true, moving forward is necessary. Still, I can't help but think about the stories we carry with us, the ones that make us who we are. Okay. I guess the essence of our memories is like a melody that lingers. It's the echoes of those notes that remind us of where we've been. It's a bit of a balancing act, isn't it? Holding on while letting go, both feels so important. I think the trick is not being too hard on yourself. So tell you about the time I took our eight in New York. Yeah, yeah. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where, though? Where? She's gone. Tric decision, probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They do. They... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. Oh, my God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry. I've become so forgetful. I just... To hear that is embarrassing. I've... I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've goodmixed me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm... I'm losing everything, things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? I used to play in. That was scary. Or... I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Or... I got this one from Violet the other day. I was the one who was missing. I... God. This is embarrassing. Okay. Here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... Yeah. I rushed into the restaurant. Violet, I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this would possibly be cool, young guy. So... Yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man bussles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that... The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist... Hmm. I was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah. And it was funny. Because you weren't cool at all. You were... You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet... And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just... Always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the bus and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and... I'm Chris. I thought I didn't know. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem. I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now... Dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I know. I didn't know immediately how to respond. But yeah, you'd already started talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like... You're holding me there. Shifting. It was... It wasn't he getting behind the curtain of someone. We just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And... How it destroyed you. And I was just... Thump struck Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all the other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my god, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to rejouit and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself and then I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear... What about your lady friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please, this was her first day and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. I'll go back here. This is you're thinking of the fool. Please. Are you a fool? You know? What's up, chair? He says it was his wallet. It's true. And my day's going to come back here and then he made it. So please just got me some slack. I saw the guy I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch when I'm aware of one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm not going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Let me go reveal you. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so why did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You're strong and slick, but the seams don't hold calling. Geno key like it's plated gold and prosketo pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to leave, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin. Guessing games you'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move. One misreply. And you're on dish duty. No alibi. The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're saying you play a slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. Now look at you. All at no great. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam. She knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I said slow and drink it in. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I'm not going to be a fan of you. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me. I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table. Turn the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, no, Tay. Then I can count from broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a grad Z. And to stare you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your meal. The same trast of array. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman jar. I'm velvet. In a hurricane. The last bite on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia in your plah. I'd. Allora strones by a fan cool. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure. Bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line. Left to right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Seasoning the air for good luck. Just in your mind, don't point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are. And now you can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping. And no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, like me and me both. Describe something now. Test band. Although orange is only a knock-off in Nebraska. We'll under the radar. Slide. Slide. The pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he can't rewind the microwave last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. My own arm. Oh, give me a guard. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. Or everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, why? But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The drops slow. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. That is as far as me. Okay. Can I take it off? Yeah. Okay. That way. Yeah. There you go. There you go. Thank you very much. What do you think? What is this? I came in with no reference. Marco said you have to meet the sky. That's what they're doing. And I have no information on what to expect. What do you think? I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. So. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. As you've previously asked me a particular question... My story is that there is only a little concern. The second guy is okay. Yes. Okay. MissÏä§ÌÉÄel, I hold relevant case in this corridor.... Okay. Okay. Oh standing in the water... Aye. Right. Wait, what can you do this one instead? Uh, the mic, yes. Seems to be where you can go. Hopefully it stays that way. Yeah, this is the one that we don't mind dying. Yeah. So, you can move it as you please. How do you stop this? Yes, I just started both of them. So, you should stop. Yeah, I know. I think that it's going to be good.\n",

Adrian In Rocky It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is It makes me have a concert even more So I'm just blabbering at her I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious To be honest I can't even remember what I was saying I think I was running about my music And how criticising I saw my name And my plans for it and somehow That just spewed out my entire life story Without stopping for breath Let alone and I'll hear it to get in word in age race And then Oh Jesus But I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop And she's just looking completely overwhelmed So I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke And just Oh it just died on me And later when I'm ordering It's this Italian place I say something dumb Asking for some G-Knocky or something equally ignorant And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron And she's just Just laughing And so I figuring that's it I'm dead I'm done And I'm screaming at myself in my head You asked whole You did it again You actually met someone really cool And just can't help but Fuck it up with the very first junction Why is wrong with you But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second It finally gets violent the opportunity to speak And she just starts talking About Architecture And The creative intent when she's designing And The music she likes And How a dream is to one day buy some land She can design a house of her own From the ground up And just Spellbound Thinking My god this skill is so fucking cool And the rest of the day just Past in a flash Tell her it was time to pay And I insisted to take care of it As I regulate so Why at least to go to bathroom And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home And the waiter who already thinks I'm going to ask all Because of the whole do notki guy Someone's over the matri day And Violets about to come back any second And convince this guy has it against me So I've gotten no more dignity left to save Right So I just fall onto my knees in front of them And I'm offering them a watch And any other possessions I had on me She's I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow And I must have looked so pathetic The matri day takes pity on me And agrees just as violet was back in And I'm still on my knees in front of them So I have to make out like I'm Trying my shoelace whilst whispering Thank you To the matri day And so So I I had to get out of it So Surely I got messed up twice in a row Can I? She's really special Thanks for coming at such short notice I've got this This thing It's for violet She's got a birthday coming up I just wanted to write it something Something that expresses what she actually means to me I just can't get it on the path What you do when you're mentally blocked Maybe I'll just show you what I've got I have this belly belly I know I don't know where it's going I mean I like it But Where is this leading Sometimes I think I should just let this music go And get a proper job like my dad says I mean Hey Tell me how to do it You know Tell me a boyfriend or girlfriend Or husband or wife What actually means to you I'm just Maybe I'm just not good at this Maybe that's it This is the universe telling you to Just stop and do something different Just Alright I'm gonna try again What do you say What do you say What do you say What do you say What do you say Come on Come play with me Come on Come on That's it That's it Keep going Keep going I was like, I'm alive and put in a little plastic, I'm pretty good with one crush. Violet sent a love, she's on the line, so she won't work for a joint. I know, I know, we're so seven. We're just joking about stuff and stuff. Violet came part of it, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were, like, ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the unperson in to take care of Ari. Anyway... Look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari... He's amazing. It's like, best day of my life, every day. It's love. Look, I had this idea, I wanted to do two, like, just a bit of a favor. I always burst those kind of words into my mind, and I was thinking about how people don't read up memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some physical part. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better to spell something that you know about whatever, like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think you could be cool for a moment. You know? See what's around it, that would be okay. So, rather than slip the paper, you can pin them on that door there. It's like you're between us. I think it's going to love us. I don't really know what they are here. They're like, sort of weird. I spend time at Ari. I remember this for my child. Things like the God. It makes me realize what a full pain that we're in. You are. You're once making me my sister, me. There she is. That picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was performing parents' part. And that place was like... Well, there's sort of sacredness in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and... Whenever we went there, we needed to aching and underneath the height. To come up with people. Live other lives. Because we're the kids, right? So, we're actually living in our imaginations of that. We've been met whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic cave round. So, we never really considered the idea that I'd be thinking. One day we got a lot of stuff left. We had a path that we always talked to get in and out. She just... Straight, I guess. The worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found me again pretty quickly. I felt like an eternity of time. And I was young. You have no real responsibility in age. What it means to actually lose something that's not there. I'm trying to keep it. Just how easy it is to lose something that you've got. Against that's why I want to have something that I want. Something permanent. I'm actually into stone, so it can't be lost, right? I'm whole. The master of the lake is in. I guess he's in to the midi-chimera. He's in to the midi. Hi. Hi there, little baby. Quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the world. What do you mean? It's not like you've been. Do you listen to yourself, or is it? No, you don't understand by yourself. I'm not allowed to make a decision. When here we still fucking need somebody. I'm not allowed to make it. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't speak this language. I have to do what I just said. No, I'll. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. I didn't. How much did you hear about it? All of it. All right. Clearly. Not the first time. Not the first time. Yeah, I'm trying to be a good father. I don't see why either. Especially with touring on time. Well, I'm approaching a little convention. Violet in the ceiling. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the opportunity? You got me. The only other thing I could show was that we left a minute ago. I could figure out what helped me taking with me. I've never been to the US because I thought all of his Christmas had came once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of it. I knew we'd have some downfiring. We spent all that time together. Me and him. We just wanted to sit in. I took into the sleep no more. Into the mat. Of course, I think it's a napkin. But I want to always be with you. I want to turn memory. It looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that is never there. I've never thought I'd think that's all that we are. You know, I was just thinking if you had to choose one thing that's happened to you so far. What's the one thing you'll never want to forget? Proposing to my wife? That's beautiful, my friend. I'm sure that was a moment that'll stay with you forever. It's funny. I was just going through some old photos and I found this one of my son, Ori. He was so little. What age was he? Which photo? It's this one of him in New York. We were on a trip together. He was so fascinated by the skyscrapers. I remember him looking up at me with these huge eyes. And he took him to sleep no more? I'll tell you about the planet of our eighth in New York. Please. No, please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost from the very start. Safer. It's safer there. Where are the... Where are... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do. They... No. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Oren. He was just here. He's helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He's helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the book... Or in the cabinet. Or in the door. Or the drawers. Or in the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Good to meet you. I've been writing my memoirs. It was just difficult because I'm losing everything. Who always did that? Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? That was scary. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to send me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Bylet's The Other Day. It's the downest thing. Yeah. Yeah. God, this is embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. That was actually running 50 minutes late. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you seemed like there was a possible young guy. The idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. We didn't have cell phones back then. I could have just ring you to check. Finally, this young man bussled into the restaurant. I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that big hair and the outfit. I was just about ready to call it quick when he finally crushed it. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. So freaked out by the fact that you were late and although I didn't know this yet And this is because of who you are Chris Always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions. Oh My god, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz. I decided that I should probably just Run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake because I counted Four buses passing me on my way and I got hot in the rain obviously by Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris I was touched by it Yeah, this complete stranger I don't know so together and beautiful when he was performing But now Dripping with water and sweat Was he was only aware of me? Like It was The conversation segway into a story about your sister Lily And how it destroyed your family after she passed away and How it's just Because it's just To open up about the things I have affected them the most deeply First days I'm usually involved in small talk I remember thinking my god, they're such bravery to the sky I actually wanted to rejoude and take your hand But I was in frame enough myself I think at that point you might have actually made a joke But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying So I didn't know whether to laugh or not I Then I started talking to you about my work and other completely in consequence of stuff I know it sounds it sounds a little corny but by dessert The house the garden the child the the getting old together And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late So I excuse myself I Yeah, god, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear No, please just this was our first day then I was really late and I insisting on paying before she went to the bathroom So she comes back here. There's sure think I'm full You know It's true and and my day's gonna come back here and then in a minute so please just got me some slack I sort of got a comeback tomorrow and settle We have the policy that no no listen listen to me.

I'm just It's Spellbound Thinking my god this skill is so fucking cool and the rest of the day just Past in a flash and tell it was time to pay and I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late So why at least to go to bathroom? I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky gate someone's over the major day And Violet's about to come back any second now convinced this guy has it against me So I've got no more dignity left to save right so I just fall onto my knees in front of them And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me and agrees just as violet walks back in and I'm still all my knees in front of them So I have to make out like I'm Time my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you to the major D and so So I Had to get out of it so Surely I got messed up twice in a row can I? She's really special Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just I've got this thing It's for violet she's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something something that Expresses what she actually means to me and I just I can't Get it on my path What you do when when you're mentally blocked? So maybe I just show you what I've got exactly I have this melody but I don't know I don't know what it's going I mean I like it but Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job like my dad says I mean Fuck Tell me how to do it You know tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife what actually means to you I Just Maybe I'm just no good at this Maybe that's it This is the universe tell me to To stop and do something different Don't don't be stupid You're an excellent your excellent musician You have just to Focus and think about violet What do you think I think this music is beautiful? Maybe this but it's it's too dark. It's too somber That's it that's nice. Yeah Look at that Wow, I love it You You You You You You You You Here Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on your bed You You No Oh Hey Sorry about that I I really wanted to meet you all but By the night I'm pretty militant about sleep training And going to the game with him and got crushed By the sender month she's on deadline so she won't be able to join us and I know I know we're so set up We're just Juggling a bit of stuff in the manly By the camp harder and she's under a lot of pressure And she and I were Like ships in the night My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of already Anyway Look Everything's great It is ori He's amazing He's like Best day of my life every day It's mad Look I had this idea I wanted you to well It's a bit of a favor Always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how People don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives And I wanted to create something physical about it It keeps safe from this part of this existence And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message It can be whatever you like it doesn't have to be a birthday message I think it's better just about something that you know About whatever life You know What you know now or what you wish you'd known that I think it'd be really cool for me to go there Yeah See it was around in my newspaper So Rub a pen With the paper You can pin them on that order Like you could do this I think he's going to love it I don't really know where they are They're in Cainfrog It's sort of weird When I spend time at ori I remember things from my childhood You know things like the God It made me realize What a ten-poor thing memory is You with ori It must be being with my sister, but There she is Not pitching She knows to play this forest Behind a family home This was the former parents part And that place was like Well I saw it sacred to us in this weird kind of way I guess because it was like hours and Whenever we went there we'd leave the 18 and the need behind Become other people live other lives Because we were kids, right? So We're literally living in our imaginations of that We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous One day they got lost of that We had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just Straight I guess There's the worst thing I've ever experienced I mean I think that she found her again pretty quickly But it felt like an eternity at the time And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age What it means to actually lose something that that they Carried it completely Just how easy it is to lose something that you love I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari Something permanent Etching stones that can't be lost, right? Oh The master is away, isn't it? Just to say I'll go see you in a minute Give me two from there I'd love to meet him Hi Hi there little buddy Daddy's here Daddy's here Oh Oh, give me a break, miss two days, it's not big My luck is shared custom You What do you mean No No I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't hear you those comments. Yeah, I was here the whole time. How much did you hear about? I didn't pay attention to be honest. It's easy to get lost in everything going on, isn't it? Sometimes we just need a moment to breathe and get around. Yes, you heard this car, a school-winning actor of man yelling at his phone. Oh, come on. It's no big deal. We all have issues in our relationship, right? Yes. I'm trying to be a good father. I know. I think it's a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. Especially with Torian all the time. I mean, it's hard to make it work between your job and your family. You're away, you're going on tour. Violet just makes a deal like that. But she also wants what's best for your son at the end of the day. He loved it. He only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? Sure. I'm taking with me. How was it? You've never been to the US. Wow. All these Christmas's came at once. Small, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. I knew we'd have some down time. I know we've had a lot of fun with them all that time together. Amazing. What did you do with them? Explore the city. I had Korean food for the first time. I love Korean. I have a sleep no more. And to the max I have quartz, I take it to the nap today. That's great. Did you go to the top of the rock and the statue of Liberty? I'm sure he loved it. He will remember that for all his life. It was human drug in the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. Of course. At that age, they fill up energy and they've got so much curiosity. I never knew what I meant to my father. We didn't have much of a relationship actually left. But I want to know what he needs to make. Exactly. And you're touching that. It looks fun. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Exactly. And you're doing right. I'm very proud of you. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. That's what left where everything is gone. Spend your whole life chasing your dreams and trying to do right for people that make a difference. But no idea if it's not impacting them or if they want it to and then bam. Just fucking it's your insignificant. How could anything that you're doing actually leave a mark? Everything that we're doing lives a mark. The success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. And people talk about chasing your dream like it's a recipe for your life to end up making sense that sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing to ease all the pain and to make it great just ends up amplifying it. And all those possibilities bring along with it just push it further and further away from the people that you love. I couldn't believe in it illusion. It's alive. This idea of the perfect life. I mean look at me. I've failed the marriage. I've barely seen my son. And I would become the father. When my parents separated. I thought it was all my fault. And that's the last thing that I want Ori to feel. It's the most important thing in my world. I think you're too hard on yourself. You're just trying. You're just doing your best. And you definitely want to be there for Henry, which is great. And Cosmetic Violet went through the fucking road. She's going to be within three months. What? You're not going to see him for three months. You've got to do interviews and all that meet the fans. I'm just going to get back for the first time. Why couldn't make it work for me for once? I mean, I suppose you have to do what you have to do. And you have the phone, you can face time. There's lots of things you can do and try to be there for him. I'm going to do a flammate like I ate in York. Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They. Do. They. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. No. No, no, no, no, no. Where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They. Do. They. No. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. And you look well as well. It's really me that's getting older. Don't be kidding. We're both getting older. How is he? How is he? How is he? He's trying to find. He must have had to lead. It's okay, don't worry. Don't worry. Come and sit with me. Just relax. He told me to try and find my glasses. Yeah. I need them to read it lunch, so. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just. I don't know where. Let me try to help you. Could you. Would you help me find them? Of course. There must be here somewhere. They could be in the bookshelf. Okay. Or in the cabinet. Found a map for. Or the drawers. Ready so much for me. Or the sofa. Maybe under the table. How about a chair? I don't think they're in there. I'm sorry, mate. I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find them. Or the plant. Well, the plant is not in the best shape. I'm so sorry I have to come so forgetful. It's okay. We all forget things. It's just normal. You know, part of aging. Don't say that. Maybe. Have you checked your pocket again? Maybe your jacket? No. I've been writing my memoirs. Oh, really? Difficult because I'm losing everything. So it's great I did you write then. So you keep it for memory forever. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? We used to play in it. Yes. You told me that story. I was scary. I know. It was just a moment. Oh. I am aware. I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I know. It's normal. We're all getting older. We are different. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkness thing. I did that. God. This is ill-enbarricied. Okay. Here it goes. It was 1990. It was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed. Yeah. I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood in the app. I was going to be there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood in the app. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this impossible, we call a young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. I wouldn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally brushed it. Yeah. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm on Chris. I thought I didn't know. I was touched by it. Yeah, this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me as how I might be feeling. And I didn't know I'd take. I didn't know we needed to be had a response. But yeah, you don't already start talking about your music and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such a good atmosphere. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely on a phrase to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I got in her sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. I was just dumbstruck Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. I don't know, all the other three states have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really, I don't know, wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. You just listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but my dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I, yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. What about your mate? No, please, this was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, please, she'll think I'm a fool. Please. But you are a fool. Gina? What's up, chair? It's true. And my day is going to come back here and then you're in it, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a rare one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, that's how you're going to play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't read my read the star. Maybe a couple of you here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love, baby. Love, baby. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Kavish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or be enough to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strongness... What's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's plated gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air. That girl's a poem, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You want to read my mind, that sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one mis-reply, and you're on dish-duty. No, all of by the music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet, and hold that grin. The plates are stacked in the sky. You're in, you play it slick, but here's the twist. One wink too slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light, forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake, so pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll be the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You'll be the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You'll be the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You'll be the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of County Port. I've seen a more walk out the door. I set the table, tuned the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, note, day, then I can count. In lines to prosecute nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And this dare you brought your grin, your little show. But fill your meal, the same trace to the ray. You played your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the candelman. And jar I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered mama me up in your plight. Allora strones by a fancou. I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you, laid down in line, left or right, or we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing, seasoning the air for good luck? Just in your mind, jump point, don't look at it too long, hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are in now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. And we better hear. Yeah, like meeky meeky. It's crack-planting now. Test band. Although I want to see something else working at Nebraska. Three of London's raider. Slide. Slide. Paolo tricks on. Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, you can't rewind my equipment last week. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You're not on the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. Ma the oh na ma gifigada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with the twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking around, you were smiling when I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. But I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed. You were smiling when I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. In the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The mandolin flares. The bass drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go in. The diners blink. That's it. That's what we have so far. Very cool. Oh, getting a heavy heart here. Yeah. But... Hello, hello. It was cool. Uh...\n",

      " Three main things that you need to know is when spoken to speak at this level. You can just read something. Number two, at some point you're going to move from this room to that room. If it's not clear, don't worry about it. I'll let you know. But hopefully it's now clear how to move. And number three, we reward people that are searching for stuff. You can look around, you can touch everything, eat everything, drink anything. Okay. There you go. Do what? Maybe a bit tighter? Interesting. So you're in the main lobby right now? Yeah. I mean, I don't see a window in there. Do you reach the Garfield Caromatic Answering? Yeah. So window, window, door, window, window, it's a frame, but no, no, no. Yeah, door over there. Window over there. Bookshelves for that. All right. Just take it a shower. I'm going to grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Hello, Red. Now I really need to work on my white pitch. But just a few seconds. I wanted to make sure you had enough to come back to here again. La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la. Welcome back. Welcome back. Yeah. What's up? How are you doing? All right. I'm sorry, I'm just having something out anyway. So what do you feel like eating French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slam it with some burgers? Chinese, sounds good to me. What do you think? All right. Chinese it is, but stay afWarning. Last time I was there, they forgot to bring me a hat for it. Wow, I didn't expect that. Chinese it is then. Can't wait to dive into some dim sum. Dim sum dumplings should work. Those dumplings are going to be amazing. Just thinking about the flavours is making my... I've been dreaming about that sweet and savory sauce. It's going to be such a feast. What's the name of the place we're going to? You know? Absolutely. I'm all in for a flavour explosion and a good time with friends. Let's make this dinner want to remember. Oh, what a coincidence. The name fits perfectly with the kind of fun we're about to have. I'm so ready for this adventure. What's in it? The place is called dinner to remember. That's perfect. It sounds like a spot where man is good to see you, A.I. Such a terrible fire. Sorry, don't touch it. It really thumbs me out. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning, or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, from Maria-Gar. So there I am this morning, a little gumber summons me to a office, and she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cup of coffee is at a 40 different document she's holding. And then it dorms on me. The gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine, man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, in the places of total lays, but I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression, and I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So I just start running from room to room, sending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again, and suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slip-challey sheen types, and two to eyeball at me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copy room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point, you know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol, and shit is coming at him from all sides, and I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office, so I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement, and the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket, so of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God, but I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it, and I'm loading up all the documents and lining the number down, and I'm thinking, I'm screwed, you Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, then I press copy, and then the arm goes up. The screen of my panel saves low heat. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy, but I know we're in over and over. That's like a big help. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full with the glare in the access system, so I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out, it's our sender, an alarm sounding, and the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swan to sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't take anything, she just stands there smiling at me, just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, and a household. That was it. They fired me on this, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Yeah, what a way to make an impression. Can anyone see your jacket out there? I just want to make sure it's not left behind. What jacket? The one on the hang green? I wish one knew me, the one on the chair. Mate. Which jacket? What do you think? I like it. Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the day? It depends on her, depends on how you feel about it. You like it yourself? It's always a bit nerve-racking, right? Just want to make sure everything's in order before heading out. Of course I like it. It's kind of a vibe, and I feel good in it. No response? Perfect. Wow. You got your answer? You really just gonna let me go out like this, huh? Thanks a lot. But whatever makes you feel understandable. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? Yeah. The first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Well, she agreed on a second date. Her name's Viola, and I met her on the gay tech side. And she's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. I don't know either, but if she goes on the wrong track. I was so late. Lord knows how long she been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a what's her name? Adrian? In Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have incognizate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music, and how criticised I could storm my name, and my plans for it, and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story, without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get in word in age raised, and then... Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop, and she's just looking completely overwhelmed, so I just thought I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke, and just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant, and the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done, and I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool, and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? You know, if she wants to see you again after this first... Probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gets violent the opportunity to speak, and she just starts talking about architecture, and her creative intent when she's designing, and the music she likes, and how a dream is to one day buy some land, so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash, and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it, because I ragged late, so why not at least go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realise I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole de-knocky gate, someone's over the matri-day. And violence about to come back any second now, I'm convinced this guy hasn't against me, so I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch, and any other possessions I had on me. Cheese, I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matri-day takes pity on me, and agrees just as violent walks by kin, and I'm still on my knees in front of them, so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the matri-day. And so... somehow... I had to even have to get out of it. So... surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Hmm. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up, and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what Shachui means to me. And... I just... I can't... get it on the path. What do you do when... when you're mentally blocked? I go for a run. Maybe I just show you what I've got. So... I have this melody, but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go. And get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean... FUH! It's all right, man. Tell me how to do it. You know how to do yourself. Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Am I just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you're to... to stop and do something different. I mean, just... All right. Let me try again. What are you saying? I like it. I think you can continue with something more ugly. I like the soft start. Come on. Here you go. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Overwork. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on all you to bed. Yeah. Like all you do is lie on the floor. Real book. At least we all have time. The world's not under our motion. This thing is not that simple. de oro de dientes de terras labios de rubir de mes y me quieres como yo te quiero si venite a cuerdas como yo de ti a veces escucho un eco divino que muerto en la brisa parece decir si te quiero mocho mocho mocho mocho tanto como en donces siempre esta morir I love this song what's it name? sorry about that? no no no I really wanted to meet you all but by the end of the day I became pretty militant and went to the gym with him and got crushed by the end of month she's on her blind so she won't be able to join us and I know we're sorry about that we're just joking about stuff and then while it came part and she's under a lot of pressure and she and I were like ships in the night my music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes what? I don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of Ori anyway look everything's great really it is Ori he's amazing he's like the best day of my life every day it's mad look I had this idea I wanted you to well it's a bit of a favour I always burst those coming up late to this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives and I wanted to create something physical for them it keepsake from this part of his existence and I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message it can be whatever you like it doesn't have to be a birthday message I think it's better if it's about something that you know like you know what you know now or what you wish you'd know that yeah I see I think it'd be really cool for when he's older I love the idea see it was around him and he's a baby yeah I should be nice so rather than I split the paper you can pin them on that board that alright I think you should do this I think he's going to love it I don't really know where they are you know, paint from it's sort of weird when I spend time at all I remember things from my childhood you know, things I've forgotten it made me realise what a temple thing is memory is he with all of it reminds me of being with my sister living there she is she's not pitching she and I used to play in this forest behind our family house this was the former parents' style and that place was like well we saw a sacred tourist in this weird kind of way I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there we'd leave the aching and lily behind and become other people live other lives because we were kids right? so we're literally living in our imaginations of that we'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles and because it just felt so like this gigantic playground so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous but then we got lost up there we had a path that we always took to get in and out and she just strage I guess it was the worst thing I've ever experienced I mean I think that she found her again pretty quickly but it felt like an eternity at the time and I was young and you have no real sense of consequences of age what it means to actually lose something but that day I was like I'm terrified I can feel it just how easy it is to lose something that you love I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you something permanent etch it into stone so it can't be lost right? I see your point oh the same time the master is awake is he just a sec I'll go see to him I'll see you buddy I I I'm a little buddy I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful.

      " Okay, so if you want to put this in your pocket, should we go to go? Come with me. Alright. So in a traditional spec, in the more, in the best way I want to do it, I would actually come in through a window. Through a window? Through a door that is right there. Yeah, but obviously pipe doesn't allow me to do that, so such as how we are. I'm going to put you in the headset. Okay. There's a couple of things in here. So when we start, I'm going to be in the room with you when we start. Basically you should see a door, a window or part of a window, a bookshelf and a window. If that's correct, then let me know and I'll get the hell out of the room. Three main things that you need to know is when spoken to, speak at this level. You can go speak like this because it just ruins everything. Number two, at some point you're going to move from this room to that room. If it's not clear, don't worry about it, I'll let you know. Hopefully it's now clear how to move. And number three, we reward people that are searching for stuff. You can look around, you can touch everything, you can eat everything, you can drink anything. Okay, that's great. Perfect. There you go. Do I... Tight enough if you want it tighter? Maybe a bit tighter. Yeah. I think that's good. Interesting. So you're in the main vlog right now? Yeah. I mean I don't see a window in here. No, yeah. I'll tell you when. Okay, now you should be able to see. Yeah? Yeah. So window, window, door, bookshelf? Window, it's a frame but not a window. Door over here? Door over there. Window over there? Yeah? We're... A bookshelf? Yeah. Alright, enjoy. Alright. You know the trail? I think you're several times a week. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink or might be here. Just two seconds. What's up? How are you doing? Sorry about the mess. I'm taking that. But here we are. So what do you feel like? I'm going to shut down your Chinese. I'm just not going to sit down with this. Chinese sounds good to me. What do you think? Alright, Chinese. Chinese. That's the one. That's the one I think. Perfect. Perfect. Let's go. Wow, I didn't expect that. Chinese, it is then. Can't wait to dive into some dim sum. Dim sum dumplings should away. Those dumplings are going to be amazing. Just thinking about the flavors is making my sense. I've been dreaming about that sweet and savory sauce. It's going to be such a feast. What's the name of the place we're going to? You know? Absolutely. I'm all in for a flavor explosion and a good time for the friends. Let's make this dinner once you remember. Oh, what a coincidence. The name fits perfectly with the kind of fun we're about to have. I'm so ready for this adventure. What's the name? The place is called dinner to remember. That's perfect. That sounds like a spot where man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. I'm sorry. In touch here. That really bumps me out. Oh, what a man. Is that a publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's an army, sort of, sure, you know, and kind of boundish. With these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, Marriaka. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. Now she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns up me. This gumber is sending me to the computer. I don't know. It doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding these things like an authoring quest. It's like on the other side of building. The place is a total maze. But I'm the new gumber. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gong-gong scared of little gumber to us without wrenching. So I just stop running from going to prove. It's ended that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, her place seems exactly insane. I charge up three fights stairs and across. And then up again, the sun will realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite. These two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit are I. And I know I'm not supposed to overuse them. But now I've been fucking towering. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything to go wrong. But I know the copy rooms and the basement. So I get out there. I start dashing back down. And I'm screaming at myself. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, the star of the film, where he's trying to escape with the idle to shit, coming to him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for all to rain. The star of the attack and hit little gumber going from back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I've run down into the right room of the basement. And the jukebox is playing. Joe Sturm is singing. I'm a master in the suit. Mark it. And I'm fundamentally doomed. But then, somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents. I need the number down. I'm thinking of screwing you, Joe. So I'm trying to last. I'm gonna make it with compressed coffee. And then the alarm goes off. The screen front panel says, low-key. So I feel it with a, I'm so desperate about this point. That's really didn't help me. Makes the security as grinding. I know, Joe. The access to the assault is far bitin'y, like everywhere. And it's on the floor, it's on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, I was sent. And the armed family. The staff are rushing to the office to see what's happening. And it's just me. Staring alongside this spring machine. Covenanting. Like, it like, I have tanks in the salt disarmness. And little goon was there. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling. Just smiling, like she's thinking. See, I knew. And I asked, that was it. I mean, it's just a job. I really wanted out of there. What am I? To knock myself in making a press conference. Yeah, what a way to make an impression. Can anyone see, I'll check it out there. I just want to make sure it's going on. What jacket? The one on the hanging tree? Or which one do you mean the one on the chair? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. He's just a good guy. He's just a good guy. I don't know. I don't know. Mate. Which jacket? And no? What is it in here? I like it. Is that me? Where is the university? Where is the university? It depends on her. And depends on how you feel about it. You like it yourself? It's always a bit nerve-racking, right? Just want to make sure everything's in order before heading out. Of course, I like it. It's kind of a vibe, and I feel good in a response. Perfect. You got your answer? You're really just going to let me go out like this. I'm not the biggest fan of the shirt to be honest. But whatever makes you feel comfortable. I'm just trying. Tell me, have you ever heard of really bad first day? Yeah. My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something mutual. Hopefully, I'll actually learn more this time. Well, she agreed on a second date, and uh... And I never won the key template. She's just really cool. She's known to be an architect, and she's funny, and beautiful. Like across between the broad shields. And Jennifer Connolly. And she's just... ...roapsed hard. I don't know either, but if she goes on a second date with you, then uh... Well, you should be fine. So, mate. Lord knows how long she been waiting for. I had to change after rehearsing. I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So, I missed the bus and ended up running to fun there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like... I don't know, a cat that just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quietly and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So, I started trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like a... ...what's it like? Adrian in Rocky? It's nice that that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious? To be honest, I can't even remember what I was saying. But I think I was running about some music, you know, how precise I extort my name, and like, plans for it and somehow, I've just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I've heard, to get a word of their choice. And then... Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop. And she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried buying the mood, like telling a joke, and just... I thought, God, they just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... ...cheat, knocky, or something equally Adrian. And the way they've just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...sit on the laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole! You did it again. You actually met someone really cold. You just can't help it. Fuck it up with the very first young shit. Why is it wrong with you? You know, if she wants to see you again after this first... ...date, we can go for it again. She's too pretty much a stupid man for a second. And finally, the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about... ...our protector. And... ...the creative intent when she's just screaming. And the music she likes. And how a dream is to one day buy some land. So, she can sign a house in the room from the ground up. And just... ...spellbound. Thinking... ...my god, this guy is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... ...hats in a flash and... ...tell his plan to pay. And I just did to take care of it. Because I ride late, so... ...while at least I go to bathroom. And I'm about to deal with it when I realize... ...I've left my planet at home. What led? The waiter. He'll already think I'm an asshole. And the whole two knocking eggs. Someone's over the major day. And... ...violence about to come back any second now. And convinced this guy has it against me. So... ...I've gotten no more dignity left to say, right? So... ...I just fall onto an easing front of them. And... ...I'm offering them the blockchain. Any other possession that had on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...come back tomorrow. And... ...I must have looked so pathetic that... ...the major D takes pity on me. And agrees just as well as what's back in it. And I'm still in my knees in front of them. So... ...I have to make out like I'm... ...thrying what she likes whilst whispering to the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had to go to the university again out of it. So... ...sure that I got messed up twice in a row. Can I? She's... ...really special. Hmm. Thanks for coming to such short notice. I've got this... ...this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday present. I just wanted to write it something. Something that... ...expresses what she actually means to me. Hmm. I just... ...can't... ...get it on my path. What do you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? I go for a run. Maybe I just show you what I've got. So... ...I have this penalty for you. I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean... ...I like it, but... ...why is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music go and... ...get a proper job. Like my dad says, I mean... It's alright, man. Tell me how to do it. You know how to do it yourself. Tell me a place from no girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just very good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stay and do something different. I mean, I just... ...or I... ...will try again. What do you think? I like it. I think you can continue with something more upbeat. I like the soft start. Come on. There you go. Stop filming this girl. That's it. That's it. I can't go. I can't go unless the path. I can't go. I can't go. I can't go. I can't go. I can't go. Overwork. Maybe something. Maybe something wrong with the path. I can't go. I can't go. I can't go. I love the song. What's the name? Hey. What's up, mate? Sorry about that. Not at all. I really wanted it to me, but... ...by the night of the two minutes of the last week, I... ...credits of getting a lot of crush. By the centre, mate, she's... ...a lot of bad guys. She won't be able to join us. I know. I know. We're supposed to have a lot of... ...just... ...juggling about stuff like that. By the camp harder, she's under a lot of pressure. She and I were... ...like ships in the night. When music takes on for them, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... ...sometimes what? Sometimes we're up all enough to tag the other person in to take care of all of it. Anyway... ...look... ...everything's fine. It is already... ...she's amazing. It's like... ...best day of my life every day. As far as... ...I had this idea. I wanted you to... ...see that in the trailer. I always birthed this for the waiting to run. And I was thinking about how... ...people get really up bad ways from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some of physical knowledge. Like what? A keepsake. From this part of his existence. What's a keepsake? It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a rest of your message. I think it's better if it's loud. It's really you know. About whatever. Right. You know... ...what you know now or what you wish you know that. Yeah. I see. I love the idea. It seems a round. Yeah, super nice. So... ...run a pad and then switch the H-packs. Yeah. Alright. I'm just gonna turn this. I'm just gonna walk it. Oh my god. Here's your Wifi. So weird. I spent time at all right. I'm gonna go get this for my child. Shit. It's like a dog. He made me realize... ...it's a full thing for every day. I'm sorry. It's a lot of work being done by Systema. There she is. I'm here. She and I used to play in this forest. I kind of bothered her. This was a full-man character. Not a place was like... Well... ...it's sort of a safe place. This weird kind of record. I guess... ...it's like an hour's in. Whenever we went there, we used to take them to leave behind. But come up with people. Live on the line. Because you're kids, right? So... ...we're actually living in our imagination. We'd been in the whole kingdom. We'd drive in the castle. And because it just brought so much... ...this giant dump-toned cave around. So we never really considered the idea of it like that. But then... One day we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. She just... ...strange, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean... I think that she found me again pretty quick. But it felt like a bit too early at the time. I was younger. You have no real sense of consequences at that age. What it means to actually do something that I've never had. And try to hide it in the corner. Just help me to see it. To do something that I've never had. I guess that's why I wanted to have something that I would. Something permanent. Etch and stones that can't be lost, right? I see your point. Well, at the same time... ...you see? I can see it too. Maybe you may have just too much of it. Hi. Hi, Dan. How are you today? How are you today? I'm fine. So, do I get the meter? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Can you see me? No. Is someone talking? No. I just see the field and the mountains in the back with the trees. Less thing happened is waking up the sun. Yeah, let me check really quickly. Because I think that's stuck again. We're finding out that this is a little bug. This is... ...which is stuck in the same bug. Okay. Give me a second. Yeah, I'll have a reverse. Oh! Put that on. And then... ...and then... ...and then... Okay. You and the lobby right? Yeah. You should see it. So, might start level five again. Nothing yet. What do you see? Main lobby. Main lobby still? Yeah. You can find it. Okay. So, everything's changing. Yeah, I'm in the room. Yeah. Same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in the room. Yeah. Same. Yeah. You want to check this? Yeah. You want to check this? Yeah. You want to check this? Yeah. Just a nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. Yeah. What else can I do for that? No. Yeah. What else can I do? What's up mate? Sorry. What's in here you guys can play? Yeah, I didn't mean to sneak up on you. How are you doing man? Did you hear it man? A bit to be honest. How are you feeling? I'm glad you're being honest with me. It's on your mind. You know just getting my thoughts together. We've got a big day ahead of us. Nothing. Going out to you, the guy was not. It was really not prior to who I am right now. Yeah, what was that about? Easy just. You want to talk about it? Yeah. I'm trying to. To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. Which is? I don't see all of that often. Especially in Tori all the time. Well. Well. I'm approaching it little and eventually. Violetism and C like that. Did I ever tell you about the time it's approaching me? No. The only other couple shows that there was no last minute. I figured what the hell I'll take you with me. And? I never been to the US because I've all his Christmas's came up. There were small shows, small, accrued in swaths for the big bands. I've had the concept, extra lucidity. I knew we'd have some time. We spent all that time together. Me and him. How old was he? Does he remember? Explored the city. And he's been petcarine food for the first time. I'm taking to sleep no more. And to the mat. I'm caught sighting his head and head up to him. And did he like it? He loved it. So. And so why don't you do it again? He stayed up late. It was him dragging me out of bed in the morning. And then do more and see more. And did you? And I've been you. I meant some father. And we didn't have much of relationship every now. But I want to know what he needs to be. I want to tell him. Memory that he looks upon falling. Not just the rock star father that was never there. After time, I think that's all the B.I. What? Number. Speaking about memory, do you remember the timescube you made for him? I've been chasing you dreams. Trying to do right for people that make a difference. But no idea if it's such an impacted number. If they want it to, then bam. Just fucking etched it. You're insignificant. No, how could anything that you're doing actually anymore? Not bad. And I tried to do it with my music. And everything that came with it, no. The success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. Hmm. To chase you dream like this, with the rest of your work. I have to end up making sense, but sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing, to ease all the pain, to make a great difference, I'm fighting. And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it, just push you further and further away from the people that love. People believe in this illusion. It's a lie. This idea is the perfect life and the block of it. I've failed the marriage. I've barely seen the sun. I've become the father. When my parents set a record, I thought it was all my fault. That's the best thing that I want all of you to do now. I want you to feel loved. I want you to know this emotion, the thought of thinking my world. So what are you going to do about it? Sorry. Sorry, I'm just frustrated. I get that. What are you going to do about it? It's very fascinating. Of course, I'm just trying to find out. If she's going to be within three months, I'm just torn Europe. North America's stadiums then. You've got to do interviews and all of me fans are bullshit. I can't make it look for me for once. You know? In many ways it did, no? I'll tell you about the time I took away your... You did? Please. Please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where I don't know. Where? Please. No, please, please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Okay. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Thing. Two. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Okay. Oh! It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You're all the same, I hate you. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You've changed? You just missed Ori. It's just here. You've helped me try to find... Find what? He was just here, he must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try to find my glasses. I don't know where. Do you have any idea? Sure. They could be the bookshelf. I don't think they are. Or in the cabinets. I found the other floor. Or all the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. I have to help out the chair. I don't think they are in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Now why would there be in the plant? I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. That's all right. So that is Paris. I have the whole time in my pocket. Maybe they are in your pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. I was just doing something cool. I'm losing everything. Who always did that? Did I tell you about the time I lost my signature? Yeah, I remember. More scary than losing your glasses. I am aware of what I used to do. I've been getting people to send me a voice note. Or call things or what they remember. I got this one from Bylett. It's the dumbest thing. God, this is embarrassing. It was a lie. I was actually born in the 15th of this year. But then I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was a possibly cool young guy. So yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just rank you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And then the honest. I was just about ready to call it Kuwait. So when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I caught in the rain obviously by a well. I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm like Chris. I thought I was touched by it. Now this complete stranger would seem. I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now. Dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me. Of how I like me feel. And I knew I'd, I didn't know we'd be doing the Hadoah respond. But yeah, you don't really start to talking about your music. And it was sort of a card. Like. A whole demeanor. Shifting. It was. It was like he could hear the card in a subway. We just met. But there was such an openness of mine. It felt almost intimate. I felt on the same cement. Like you were completely unhappy to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into this story about your sister. Really? And how it destroyed her family after she passed away. And yeah, I would just treat you. And I was just. Like a Chris. Because it's just, it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And you know, all the other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, there's such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. And then, I think. I think at that point you might have actually made a dog. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. That I wasn't really, I don't know, wasn't really being attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. And then I started talking to you about my work. And other people think me and constantly stuff. And I need to listen. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds. It sounds a little corny, but my dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I think of the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, god. I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow as I'm paying. I swear. What about you, baby? Sure, this year, I was walking as well. No, please. This was our first date and I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she goes back here, this... I should have thinking of a fool. Please. You're awful. You know? What's that, Shay? He says it wasn't your wallet. It's true. And my day's going to come back here and then you minute. So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. And I... We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And for this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. Now, it's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a three-course meal? At the white. Don't forget the white. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I couldn't read your wine? Oh, you got a pink healing. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah. I'm going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. Do you think you're David Copperfield, huh? Yeah. I didn't realize I'd never start. I'd never come for you. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you got to lose at this point? Laban. Laban. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be done with enough to be a genius. Right enough to be dangerous. What? Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This drones... what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the scenes don't hold callin' Geno key like it's plated gold and post-cato pizza. Lands with flair, I nearly choked on the midnight air That girls oppose, cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on the magazine, your flash of smile, trip on grace, you tried to leave, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind, that's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill, no wallet now, oh what a thrill. You slid me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope, the flicker in your last ditch hope. You think you're close, you're still page one, and I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend, your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one mis-triplei, and you're on dish duty, no alibi, the music swells. The moment spins, you'd love to hard nobody wins. So place your bet, and hold that grin, the plates are stacked, and soaps your sin, you play a slick. But here's the twist, one wink, two slow, one move you missed. Now look at you, all at no price, a punchline wearing her perfume's trace, you pranced in light. Forgot the stakes, she saw the seam, she knows the bake, so pitch your charm, reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within, but if she laughs and waves, goodbye, I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt, you'll beg and spin, while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things, a major date, a mind reader, a mood sculptor, a miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port, I've seen a mor, walk out the door, I set the table, turn the lights, I cue the strings that kiss the night, I save you, no tape, and I can count, from broken lines to Prosecco nights, I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy, and the stare he parked your grin, your little show, but fill your ne'o, the st-trust of a ray, you play your part, I won't deny, but you can't trick the King Del Manjar, I velvet, in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate, the whispered Mama Nea in your plight. A Laura strums by a fan call, I am not a man, I'm Gino, don't even try. Great, just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left to right, but we start here, the salt. Everyone starts on this. What do we do in season here for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, you don't look at it too long, hold it, that is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step. Only the object decided, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line, just follow. I don't follow, I bleed. Slide, slide. You think you can read my mind? He says more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. Better here. Yeah, like me, people. It's great, right there. That's better. Although all season, no, for the rest, real under the rail. Slide, slide. Pilot tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, you thought to rewind my grip last week, hey. You know that there's anymore, they're falling away. Slide. You know, the salt anymore, that part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either, which means this is your object. My dawn, now. Get figured out. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snap the time with the twist rainbow. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked when you were going to try. It was the same way you looked when you played. Great. From everything. From yourself. And as people are watching out, I'm just glad that you guys did well. The users shook their head and told me they even were in. But I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out of you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. In the red and yellow sunset covered the streets, which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. Good job. That's it. That's as far as we go. Here you go. This is what? Yeah, yeah. I'll take you over there. There you go. That's anything. I'm thinking I will take this. Zero buttons. Yeah, just a little button. There. Thanks. Like a phone for a shirt. Yeah, it's yours. That's it. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n",

I meant to clean up but we're eating out anyway so it's not a big deal. What do you feel like eating? We could do French, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers. I like the Italian. Alright but seriously they're going to put pictures of us on the client of the decade and it's only a six. What can I buy a silo to eat some pasta? This sounds perfect. I was thinking we could check out that new place downtown. I've heard great things about their spaghetti bolognaise. Alright let's do it. Let me just grab my jacket and we can head out. I'm starving by the way. I have some news to share with you later about the job I interviewed for. I'm interested in here. I'm really hoping I got it. Keep your fingers crossed for me. Shall we go? I'm sure others are probably waiting for us already. It can wait till we're all sitting down. Don't want to jinx it. But trust me it's big if it happens. Huge. I got a stomach sign. Yeah let's go. Right behind you. I'll lock up. Oh and by the way I made a mixtape for the ride. Some of the latest from Durand Durand and the Cure. Man is good to see you eh. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me she looks like she wants to kill me. She's um sort of short you know and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front maria cut. So there I am this morning and little gumber summons me to her office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this fucking machine man, I swear, Sarah might be little gumber. But just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs and across and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slit Charlie Sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. I know the copy room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And I'm just looking at the view box he's playing and Joe Stummer singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up with a document and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy and an alarm goes off. And the screen on the front panel says no ink. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over and that is like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And noot she goes full into Blair in the access system. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls on the floors on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper. It's our send an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, covenating, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See I knew and I asked hold. That was it. They fired me on this spot. I mean it's just a job but you know I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression if you want. Hey can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. I can see your jacket. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this to the date? Yes, that's good. I just don't want to look like I'm trying for a correct. No, it's fine. You have to understand. You see Paul? Ouch. Okay. I guess I'll go change before the fashion police come banging on the door. Yeah. Probably right. I don't want to think I'm moonlight as a roadie for many bidelli. Yeah. You're probably right. Don't want to think I'm moonlight as a roadie for Mellie Vanilla. All right, I'll ditch it. Maybe something more Beverly Hills, Lionel 2 1L and last Bill's and Ted. Fine, I'm going to do it again. All right, I'll ditch it. Maybe something more Beverly Hills, Lionel 2 1L and last Bill's and Ted. That sounds good. Fine. We're fine, we're up looking like... Fine. We're up looking like vanilla rice, bath on you. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I look like... I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like what's her name? Adrian in Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have them compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I'd storm my name and my plans for it and somehow I'd just spewed out my entire life story. But I'm stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get in word and age raise. And then... Oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking non-stop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I'd try lying the mood by telling a joke and just... Oh, god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's just Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some... ...g-knocky or something equally ignorant. And the weight is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... ...start laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but... ...fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about... ...architecture and... ...percreative intent when she's designing and... ...the music she likes and... ...how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of her own from the ground up. I'm just... ...spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just... ...past in a flash and... ...till it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late so... ...while at least to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realise... ...I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole... ...dunocky guy, someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on my cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major D takes pity on me... ...and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and... ...I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the major D. And so... ...somehow... ...I had to even have to get out of it. So... ...surely I got messed up twice in a row. Can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short hours. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And... ...I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what she actually means to me. And... ...I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. What do you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I just show you what I've got. I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job like my dad says. Fuck! Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. All right. Let me try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. From play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting our eatabad. Okay. Okay. I'm just putting our eatabad. I'm just putting our eatabad. That's the endless tomorrow. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted it to meet you all. But by the live, completely innocent of our speech training. You're going to give them your crush. By the sender love, she's on deadline. So she won't be able to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, and so on. We're just joking about stuff. By the pain partner, she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were... ...like ships in a night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the other person in to take care of R.E. Anyway, look. Everything's great. Really, it is. R.E. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to... Well, you see a bit of a failure. I always birthed those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create some in physical body. It keeps safe from this part of their existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when it's older. See what was around everyone in the pain. So, rather than I slip the paper, you can pin them on that order. It's like you could do this. I think it's going to love it. I don't really know where they are and where they are from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orange, I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I'd forgotten. It made me realize what I couldn't call saying that when I met. He with Orange reminds me of being with my sister, me. There she is. And I'll pitch her. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former parents' thought. And that place was like, you saw them sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. Become other people. Live other lives. Because we were kids. So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic pay-around. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. There was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, and she was back in eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that that day. Carrying, fighting, completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. I'm getting just stones that can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, isn't he? Just a second. I'm going to see two of them. Maybe you can meet him. He isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Mr. Tundey, it's not big. Bye, miss. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days of school, because I want to take him on tour, and spend some quality time with my son, what do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. He's listening to yourself for a second, don't you? No, you don't understand, by the way. I'm actually a love to make a decision, but I'm wondering every single fucking detail about you. Do you todays what you're told to see the world the way he gets? By the last lot of that. No. No, look by that. But listen to me, look. I... We're going to have to pick this later. I have to pick the right one. So, no, I'll... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Speak. Finish me. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... Here you go, it's coming. How much did you hear about? Not too much. Wow, okay, you've dropped that. I mean, did you at least hear the power I made a good point? No? Biggest. Yes, I did. I think they just... Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. And to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with Torian all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But... Violet just looks to you like that. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the origin of York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured, what the hell? I'll take him with me. I've never been to the US. That all his Christmases came once. And there were some small shows, small, acoustic swats for the big bands that liked the concept of exclusivity. But I knew it often down time. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explore the city. I took him to sleep in the moron. And to the mat. Of course I take it to the nap thing. The stream perched as I was in third. And stayed up late. The show. It was human drug in the arbet in the morning. And see more. I don't know when you were I met my father. We didn't have much of a relationship actually there. But I want to know what he needs to mean. I want him to memory that he looks upon it on me. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm very. And I spend your whole life chasing your dreams. I'm trying to do right for people that make a difference. But no idea if it's actually impacting them or. Bam! It's just fucking history. You're insignificant. No, how could anything that you're doing actually leave? No, I tried to do it with my music and everything that came with it. No, the success, the money, the fame, the family, just to be happy. And people talk about chasing your dreams like it's a recipe for your life to end up making sense. But sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the thing that you're chasing to ease all the pain and to make it great just sends up amplifying it. And all those responsibilities that you bring along with it just pushes further and further away from the people that you love. People believe in this illusion. It's alive. This idea of the perfect life that he looked at me. I've failed the marriage. I've barely seen the sun. And I've become the father. When my parents separated, I thought it was all my fault. And that's the last thing that I want to worry to feel. I wanted to feel loved. I wanted to know that it's the most important thing in my world. Sorry. Sorry, I'm just frustrated. I took inspiration from the past weekend and caused by it went through the fucking road. But she's going to be within three months. Because I'm touring Europe and North America's stadiums. You've got to do interviews and all of them meet the fans. All shit. Just get back from the earth. Why can't make it work for me for once? You know? I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in Europe. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Take. Take. Take. No. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the past. You have to. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Take. Do. Date. No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't let them. Please don't. told you stay in the path you have to. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in now. Let me have a look at you. My God, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find her. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh, no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch. They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf or in the cabinet. I found them there before. All the drawers. All the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there. Or the piano. Or the plant. Sorry, I've become so forgetful. Oh, dear, that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I've been writing my memoirs. It's just difficult because I'm losing everything in things. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet. It's the darkest thing. God, this is embarrassing. Okay, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. I rushed into the restaurant. You weren't there. I started to worry that you might have stood me up. You just seemed like this was a possibly cool young guy. The idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. We didn't have cell phones back then. We didn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally questioned. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how either people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I was touched by it. Yeah, this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together. And beautiful when he was performing. And now dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. I didn't know I immediately had a response. You don't already started talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like your whole demeanor shifted. It was like peeking behind the curtain. And we just met. But there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like you were completely unhappy to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I've gotten resisted. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. I don't know, all my other first days have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember sinking. My God, there's such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't really at that point. I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to think. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I think the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? I am. God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay. What about your lady friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please. This was her first day. And I was really late. And I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I should think of my fool. Please. But you are a fool. She and I are. She says it was her wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here. And any minute, please, just got me some slack. I surely got a comeback tomorrow and settled up. We have the policy that... No, no, listen. Listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And with this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? Do you think that's going to cover a three-course meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm not going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a David Copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Maybe I could reveal him. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... Where did you go to lose at this point? La P√©ne. La P√©ne. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. A wish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain-off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your... Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold, calling Gino Key like it's plated, gold and proscato pizza, lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him, cool and clean, and you're the best. Your scribbles on the magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to leave, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win, you want to read my mind. That sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, your grin, you check the bill, no wallet, now, oh, what a thrill. You've slit me a bracelet, collateral chic, and promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the heart for you.

You know the trail makers have at home grab a coffee or whatever just don't drink on my beer might be good hello there by mistake a Oh there you are. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up. But since we're eating out anyway, what do you think sounds good? French, Italian, Chinese, or should we just slum it and go for burgers? Ah, Italian. Italian. Ooh, you're speaking my language. Bring on the pizza, Diavola. I'm ready for it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. Pizza Diavola, sounds perfect. Wow, I can't believe how quickly the day flew by. Italian sounds amazing. I'm always up for some good pasta. That's a fantastic choice. I didn't see that coming. But now I'm really craving some spicy sauce and fresh bread. Let's go for it. I'm hungry. I'm starving as well. So let's go. I'm here to dive into some delicious flavors. Can't wait to savor every bite of that meal. Absolutely. I'm here to have some delicious flavors. I can't wait to savor every bite of that meal. Absolutely. Nothing beats the feeling of hunger and anticipation before a great meal. Let's make it a feast to remember. Yeah, let's do it. Where should we eat? Where should we go? How about starting with some classic brusquetta? It's the perfect way to kick off an Italian feast and get those taste buds tingling. There's this great little place downtown with amazing reviews. They say their atmosphere is just as good as the food. And it feels like the heart of Italy right in our city. Man, it's good to see you, eh? I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Okay. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. No exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as sight at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning. A little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the press she's under to get a current project completed. And as you need to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. But this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be a little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to us with our actions. So I just start running from room to room, standing that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types ensued to eyeball me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. So I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film, when he's trying to escape with the idol, and she's coming at him from all sides. And I'm so gasped, I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumbe yelling from the back of the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Stummer's singing. Am I last in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. Yay! And I'm loading up all the documents. And I'm thinking, scream, you Joe Stummer. I'm not so dumb. I'm gonna make it. The non-acrest copy. And the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, no ink. So I fill it with ink. So desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy by an over and over and over. And that looks like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And then she goes full into Blair and the access to this. Oh wow. And at the same time, they keep repeating that thing, like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper at its house and an alarm sounding. And the staff are worried from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, Covered it in looking like our text in the center of sadness. Her little goombas there, but she doesn't say anything. She just sounds there smiling at me. She's smiling like she's thinking, I knew. I know, I was whole. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Can you see my jacket out there? I can't. I'm sure I don't forget it. You know how I can get sometimes. Yeah, it's here. I got your jacket. I do have your jackets. What do you want me to do with it? I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. If this machine were recorded, it's about an hour's worth of it. What do you think? The good, yeah. I like the leather jacket. Yeah. Looking rock and roll. I can wear that myself. Yeah, it looks nice. Like the shirt, like the leather jacket. Yeah. Because you never know when I want to pop back on the phone. I appreciate that. I always feel a bit more confident when I'm wearing it. Especially with everything going on lately. That probably mean that looked too good. And your chance of my style. No, I think you look fine. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Have you ever had a really bad first date? I did. Yes. ...was a total disaster... ...that's why I'm going for this. Something... ...neutral. I wouldn't call that neutral but yeah. People just remember that you are terribly ill right now. At the moment I pushed the guitar button in and it ran smoothly. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. Wow. And she's just really smart. Yeah, mate. No. I don't know yet. I thought knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsing. I just jumped myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. Oh my gosh. I missed the bus. So nice. Ended up right into run now. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I started trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell anything. She's just sitting there so still sort of like, uh, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice as that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have an compensate even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow just spewed out my entire life story, but I'll stop it for breath. Let alone, I'll heard to get in word in age racing. Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking on stuff and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just, like, all it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it over with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? Don't be jizz off, honestly, mate. You did your best. So it's fine. I mean, she laughed at least. Because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It's fine because I let the opportunity to speak. And she just starts talking about architecture, the creative intent when she's designing and the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of a roaming from the ground up and just spellbound. Thinking, my god, this skill is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late. So why not at least to go to bathroom? And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. Right. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole gene occipate, someone's over the matri-date. And why let's about to come back any second now? I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me, cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just, if they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic. The matri-date takes pity on me and agrees just as violent walks my kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace with my friend to the matri-date. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messed up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. No. It's coming at such short notice. I've got this thing. It's for violence. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write it something. Something that expresses what Shatchel means to me. And I just can't get it on the path. What'd you do when you're mentally blocked? I don't know, mate. Just go for a walk or a water movie or something. I understand here. Yeah, the tracking is not perfect, because it's like in the middle of the table. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, we know that. All right, just let you know. I don't know where it's going. Love the shanley, really. I like it, but where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go. Get a proper job, like my dad says. I mean, fuck. Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to stop and do something different. No, mate. You're just very acting. Just go for a stroll outside. Really? Just water movie or something. We'll come to you. Trust me. When you least expect, we'll come to you. Yeah. Don't just over try it. No. What do you think? I think it's starting to look good, actually. Yeah, I enjoy it. Come on. That's good. I'm enjoying it. Yeah. I'd like me to play with you. All right. Let's do it. I can only play one song and it's pathetic. Come on, don't be scared. Am I playing anything? That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. Where are we going? There we go. on , meiden sumhappy I'm just sitting. What did you want me to go? Meet yourselves at home. I'm just putting on each bed. Okay. Sure I got to do that. Oh, it's a nice piano. I'm sorry. I'm just sitting. I'm just sitting. Hey. Hey. Hey, my mom. I really wanted to meet you but by the night I'm pretty militant of our sleep training and the winter of game rhythm and you're crushed. By the sender love, she's on the line so she won't be able to join us. And I know, I know, we're so sadder. We're just joking a bit of stuff and then I'm like, I saw it. By the pain partner and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously but sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our anyway. Look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ory, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a favor. Okay. I always burst those coming up legs this month and I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps it from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know about whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for better gold. It's here with the round of money. So, rather than a slip of paper, you can pin them on that wall of that. That's okay. Sure, I'll do that. Is it paper? That's all right. Is it tape? Is it paper? All right. It's sort of weird. It's a nice idea though. I like it. I remember things from my childhood. Things like this on. It made me realize what a temple is. What's in front of me. He was already. The month we were being with my sister, really. There she is. A picture. She and I used to play this forest. Oh yeah, you think I don't know. I think I was. This was before my parents thought. That place was like. Well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the knee behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we're the kids, right? We're not living in our imaginations of that. We'd invent whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. Because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just. Straight, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually do something that that day. I'm trying to find a completely. Just how easy it is to do something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etch it into stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is away, can we? Just to set. I'm going to see you two of them. Maybe you can meet him. Yeah, I want to meet him. Sure. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Missed two days. It's not big. By the way, it's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, he misses a couple days of school because I want to take him on tour. And spend some quality time with my son. It's not actually the end of the book. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he'd been. Gee, listen to yourself for a second. Oh, yeah. No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually a loudspeaker decision without money. Are we still a fucking decent, Violet? Good thing you're still the world's way, yes. Violet, I'm slow. No. No, no, Violet. Violet is a bit low-pike. You don't think you're playing with a bike? I think I'm playing with a bike. Yeah. Yeah. Nice, nice. Oh. Fine. Oh. Wait. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. I didn't... I didn't hear you guys coming. That's all right. How much? Did you hear it back? Ah, pretty much everything. Pretty much everything. And you know that was not the best moment. That's a rhyming, we leave and learn. It's all right. It's a rhyming, we leave and learn. It's all right. You know, I'm trying to... To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all of that often. You know, especially with touring all the time. Well, I'm approaching it a little unconventionally. But by let's just let's feel like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took origin of you? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute. But I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He never been to the US. Because all his Christmases came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swats for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some down time. I just spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And got Korean food for the first time. I took into the sleep no more. And to the mat, I took it to the nap. Wow. A shame you won't remember all of that. But still, that was a great experience for sure. I think it was about a few things. It was awesome. You stayed up late for the shows. It was him dragging me out bed in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. You know kids there was so much energy. They wanted to do everything. I know of a new I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of relationship after he left. I don't know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that it looks on fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. I see what you mean. I'm sorry. Yeah. What's the one thing you know that you would never want to forget? Those moments that shape us, right? The one thing I never wanted to forget. I don't know. My very first kiss. It's like a thread weaving through our lives. Sometimes I wonder if I'm holding onto my own threads tightly enough. That first kiss. It's like a snapshot, isn't it? A moment that stays with you. That's an amazing sense and excitement of youth. Absolutely. How about you? Was the one moment that you can't forget? It's those memories. They linger like echoes, shaping who we are. I often think about how I want to share those stories with Ori. To help him hold on to his own moments. There's a moment I cherish. The day I first held Ori feeling like time stood still. It's a memory I want to keep close. Like a treasure. I'll tell you about the time I took out Ethan and York. It did. Just tell me that. Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... She's gone. Tric decision. Probably. Definitely smart. She was. Always was. Of course she knew I was always lost. From the very start. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you, stay in the path you have to. What do they think? Heh. Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. They... Do. They... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. You look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be really me that's getting older. Um... You just missed Ori. He was just here. Um... He was helping me trying to find... Hmm. He was just here. He must have had to leave. Oh no. That's it. He told me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read at lunch, so... I can help you find your glasses if you want. I don't know where. Could you... I'm trying to, yeah. Would you help me find them? I'm trying to find your glasses, yeah. There could be in the bookshelf. In the bookshelf. Let's see. Or... Or in the cabinet. I've found them there before. I don't really see them now. Or the drawers. The drawers which drawers? Or the sofa. The sofa maybe, no. Or maybe under the table. Under the table, no. I can't really see you. Maybe under the drawer, see you. I didn't think they were on there, but... Or the piano. No. Maybe under the piano if I can open it. Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry I've become so forgetful. What? Where's he put him? Yeah. Oh, I see that that is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. I did. Oh, that's why I can find them. That's all right. Don't worry about that. Goodness for me. That's okay. I've been writing my memoirs. Difficult. Just don't write about what you put your glasses on. That's something. There's everything else. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest who used to play it? You did. A long time ago you did. Actually, yeah. Oh, Gary. Yeah. Oh. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. So the recordings of what they remember. Right. Oh. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. I... Yeah. Oh my god. Is this own barricade? Okay. Here it goes. It was 1990. And it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... Yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. And then... I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean... When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like there's a possibly cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely impossible. And we didn't have cell phones back then. So I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember? I had only seen you with makeup. So I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm cleanest... It was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah. And it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet. And this is because of who you are, Chris. And I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm most of buzzed and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but... Well, I mean, I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris. I thought I didn't know. I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I knew I didn't know we immediately had a response. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music. And it was sort of incredible. Like, you hold a meter, and you shift it. It was... It wasn't peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such an openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story I thought your sister, Lily, and how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just... Thumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extreme you're rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small dog. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think... I think at that point you might have actually made a dog. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. So then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like, you really wanted to hear. And then I knew it sounds a little corny, but by dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. Like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself. Robin? Oh yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I saw it. What is this? This was our first day and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. She'll think of a fool. Please. You are a fool. What's that? That's true. And my day is going to come back here and then you mean it? So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. Yeah, or this bracelet, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow, that's what you're going with? You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, there you go. Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, I'm going to play this. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're a big, cobb-a-fool, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had to start. Maybe God knew him. Seriously, I privit to you and you're the bracelet and well and clear it. The way this was is so funny. Well, did you go up to lose at this point? La Bain√©. La Bain√©. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, but why not to be dangerous? Huh. Excuse me, seniorius, senior. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. Cherep Budds. Great. I Love the song I You're acting charming but near the end one wrong move one mistrefly in your own dish Do you know? I'm running really late. I just realized the time am I okay? I just really want to see the magic trick. I'm really enjoying it. It's just that I look at the time I was supposed to be in a dinner party at 8 p.m. Which I'm definitely not gonna be because I still need to pass home to feed my dog. It's just today. I've been A headache day. I love the song. It's beautiful. Was he say I generated no? Ah, ah, floss. Yeah, I love it. I Been called many things a major day a mind reader a mood sculptor a miracle in soft souls But me I'm just genome I know the sigh of county port I've seen a more walk out the door. I set the table to the lights I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you no tape that I can count From broken lines to Prosecco nights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy And to stare you brought your grin your little show But fill your me the same trash to the ray you played your part. I won't deny But you can't trick the kindelman jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane the last bite on a porcelain plate The whisper momma me in your plate Oh Strong By a fan who I am not a man I'm genome Even there Great just great show us what you got yeah show us Okay, no pressure Chris. No way to the boys kills me. Yeah, Sherwin. Sherwin, you got Read my mind then there are five objects in front of you later online left or right or we start here the soul Everyone starts on this What are we doing season in the air for good luck Just in your mind don't point don't look at it too long hold it. I got as your beginning When I say slide you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now You can move left or right whichever is closer one step only the object beside it no skipping and no jumping to the other side of the life just follow I don't follow I Slide Slide You think you can read my mind This has more locked up than a mob account in witness protection. Oh better here Slide Slide The politics on your family must be thrilled You know this anymore the fall and away Slide You're not under salt anymore that parts over slide That means this is not it either Which means this is yay it worked Oh It's I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track It was the same way you look when you play Uh-huh free from everything From yourself And as we were walking out You were smiling and I asked you why But you just shook your head and told me that you were worried But I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Oh So insecure because you never believed that someone like me What enjoys spending time with someone like me And we walked outside You know red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steam This was the best day of my life Oh Time to You That's it cool We're still working on We can good I got if you want I can write down Yeah, they're gonna not to give you a questionnaire Oh, okay, then because I could send you all of my notes but I think they asked you with mocap and things like that Don't worry about it No, I know for a fact that you'll do But uh But yeah, dude it's uh It's quite magical. I mean I'm very used to mixed reality But it's always so magical like I was having a lot of fun Just while we go Those double houses Just just put my my food in and not sing it as if the object was really there, you know So so good just tricks your brain But I really like it my favorite part is the The tiny every one everyone This is gonna go down to the everyone's gonna love just that It's so funny the way they dance in such a It's just stirring was so funny. It is a very tiny. It's just I love it so much, you know on table So but there are some Kind of dead moments right? We kind of fell asleep or almost I didn't but almost Everything on this idea yeah, especially so it took a little long and That for example the last scene that you saw is quite hard on you but also the last scene that you saw that's an entire film That's an entire film so it's gonna be a film is right now all the images. Oh, yeah I was gonna ask you that because obviously these images are like AI generator We kind of cheap obviously I assume that that wouldn't be that's a film yeah, that's a that's a four camera film So if you look at like this camera over here is Chris the camera behind yes, I love that concept I love it. I love actually love it. I love being in the center of the action where I see Chris on this side And then yeah And then the only thing is the choreo for his the correct choreography, but just not the correct camera would So that's that that so that that entire scene is gonna be a it's a film And then the part that we're like I think that the toughest part is It's seen for so when you move from here to that From that figure and then he comes out and tells you about Ori and But why then you go to the forest and you write the message and all that that's kind of cool But then you get to that scene five which is really heavy it is really heavy like when the guy's getting old and it gets everything Then he teased and now it's on the yeah, it's it's quite heavy But I'm saying that kind of makes me laugh But because I don't know like I didn't see I try not to take it really seriously No, no, no, I'm saying like I'm interested like he gets like for me like at least in when I do Look at it the heaviness of Like it gets heavy that Like you're saying like you fall asleep a little bit that kind of thing is because the diet of so long That was really long and really long yeah, and so that's that's the also what I felt maybe to me because you know I tend to interact with characters and everything. I felt that They did not interact that much just tying a bit like I had to Cosly remind myself again don't talk until they finish and sometimes you look that if they they were finishing They were you know, especially all that side over there like I kept on the guy but then I would see you know, yeah We're having mids of the same. Don't know. Here's the thing right Um We tried it that way. Oh, and the kids we give an hour and a half. Oh shit. Yeah, of course Yeah, because then people keep on talking And because yeah, because it's so exciting to be able to talk to you know Yeah, but that's why we we kind of had to manage it Because otherwise literally the first time that I tested it was an hour and a half Like that's too long. So so this is like the the version of right right like the in scene five when he goes what you're Like what's the favorite that's something we implemented today. Oh seriously When I said the first kiss because there was originally that was an entire other monologue Now on the trick itself You work with other people Huh? It worked on other people. Oh everybody is work is work. It's work. They're really They're getting pressed Because I felt like the tone In which he said at the very beginning when he's the living destruction. He goes like okay But you place your finger or your mind on salt and then slide whenever I say it's too fast And it's the way he said it like for me. It's me Is he you Is it you and that's just a placeholder. Oh wow. I'm recording. I'm recording re is doing it. Okay, so he's got I can slow him down a little bit Yeah, because It worked with everyone that it's not it was just for me. I felt it was been too fast But you might Are you going to end the salt and then slide it? It was just too fast like I would say okay My biggest concern was the you think that the so I have I have the full edit right now And I can slow things down and except Reese is gonna record all the that then all things are gonna record it The tar trek but the question is do you think that the comments and And the like the color that I'm putting around it the jokes. No, they're very funny. They're very funny And I didn't lose track because I was really focusing on you know on my object and they were really funny Like I thought the the earth there was just one though There was a bit too much that I could get distracted and it was So he say size size size size it's between yet. So he say size side And then there's a comment from the waiter I don't use that but it's like And then the other guy still says something I Oh you say Your family is gonna be so proud That's the one that I thought about taking away Because he then then the little thing Oh yeah that's not that's not yeah, I didn't get that one like I saw he says something and I didn't quite get it I was like but that's that actually thought that that's the one that I might because when he goes Well, we always start with the soul is like are we seasoning the air for good luck other that's funny. Yeah, and then it's like Yeah, do you follow I don't follow I lead I love that And then I and then my idea was actually to take when he goes slide slide slide. Oh, part of the trick But I thought that's don't if I'm gonna take one out. Yeah, that's the one because But even even the power tricks I like it. I just don't like the other guy saying But yeah, I mean Um, so basically We're gonna double it at the end of the month We'll do another test of this because all this stuff that you have in there is not for me is for them I have I'm not taking any of that data To understand it but then in we do get the Venice, you know, we get invited to Venice then in August I'll do another test of this with Instead of having like right now, we're having seven eight people every single day. I have like three or four people for like three four days And get feedback really quickly. Oh, okay, that that way Yeah, take a look. You know like Frontier. I mean, this is our This is our six-bill\n",

      " Just fairs fair. And so a couple things. I'm going to be here at the beginning of the piece, right? I need you to check if there's a door. OK? Here. OK. A window. A window. And a bookshelf. Sure. OK. Listen. So once that's good, then I get out because that means everything is set up. Set up. OK. Few things. Speak at this level. Speak low. You need to speak at a nice level. OK. You don't make a here. Please wait for him to finish talking before you speak. OK. Just bugs that exist in this thing. Yeah, for fun. Obviously some of the more caps and things like that. Some technical elements we know about is just we have to fix them. And then at a certain point, you're going to move from this room to the next room. If it doesn't become apparent, I'll let you know when to move. OK. And then the last one is we reward exploration. The entire room is for you to play with. OK. You can touch, taste, drink, do whatever you want. OK. Fair enough. I'll try. I'll try to do as much exploring as possible. You see if this will work with my glasses. Yeah, you should. There you go. OK. There you go. You're good. Thanks, so. OK. Let me touch you up. There you go. You're good? Good. Good. Yeah. All right. There you go. Lane Lobby. Lane. Lane Lobby Hayƒ±rivec. Don, you know, You know the world grounds of Remembers, you do need to call them once in a while. Can't wait to hear what about it, you're in the limit. Oh nice. You remember the Remembers in that kite kite? Just take a moment. You know the drill, makers never at home, breven coffee or whatever. Just don't drink or my beer. Ta-da. I wanna new dog, just use the white seat. Cheese. Wanted to very well groomed and doesn't have too many. Yeah. I wanna new dog. Oh. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what sounds good to you, French, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers? I think I'm up for some burgers, good. Yeah, so tell me a little bit about all of this, the books I was just looking at them. No worries about the books, I was just studying for a bit, nothing too exciting. Okay, okay, fair enough, fair enough. Nice places you have here. Wait, don't go. We're supposed to go eat with the others, aren't we? I have some news to share with you guys about the job I applied for. I'm really hoping I got it, been stressing about it all week. But I'll tell you all about it at the restaurant. Let's go. Thanks, it's nothing special, just a place to crash. But it's home, you know. Want to grab my jacket and get going? Everyone's probably waiting for us. Okay. Where, oh. Let me just turn off the stereo real quick. Don't want to leave the music playing all day. It's that new album from Bon Jovi. Have you listened to it yet? No worries, take your time by the way. Have you seen my Walkman? I think I left it on the couch. Man is good to see you, A. I had such a terrible day I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry, internship. Uh. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just to cite me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's, um, sort of, sure, you know, and a kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, uh, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So there I am this morning, a little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to triplicate copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy. And I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got-gump scared of little gumber to ask for directions. I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit Charlie Sheen types ensued to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room is in the basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling from the back of the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. Am I last in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number dials. And I'm thinking screw you Joe Summer. I am lost. Now I'm gonna make it. But then I press copy. And then an alarm goes off. And then the screen on the front panel says low in. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. And then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full into blur in the excess. So I was vomiting ink like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's a fire in paper. It's our send and alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveniting, looking like our text in the swamp of sadness. And little Goomba's there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking. See, I knew. And a household. That was it. They fired me on this thought. I mean, it's just a job. But you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to knock myself and make an impressing for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Yes, I can. It's here. I'm using. What do you think? Yeah, look good. Is there any possible universe in which issue? Where this for the day? No, I think you're looking good. Thanks, man. Trying to make a good impression tonight. I see that. No response. Why does this about this date, to be honest? You really just think about it all day. Thanks a lot. It's going to. It's going to. It's it's. It's. It's important that I get this right. I know. I know. I see that. It's important to you. Yeah. My face. It was. A total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something. Mutual. Hopefully. I'll actually look normal this time. You do. You do. And I met her one day, Kate, I played. She's just really cool. She's starting to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful. Like across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. I think you're in love. Looks like. I was like, what happened on the first day? No, tell me. God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up going to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there. So still sort of like what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky. It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So I'm just blivering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticised I extort my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll heard to get a word in age raised. And then, oh, Jesus. Then I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just, starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. You asshole. You did it again. You actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally gives Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and her creative intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up. I'm just... Spellbound. Thinking, my god, this girl is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her what was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I regulate so Violet leads to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate. Someone's over the maturday. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. So I've gotten no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possession to have on me cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of god cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the matriety takes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin. And I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. So the matriety. And so somehow I had too much to get out of it. So surely I can't mess it up twice in a row. Can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... This thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. And I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. Okay. And I just... I can't... Get it on the path. What you do when you're mentally blocked. I don't think it's just... Did you have to show you what I've got? Yeah. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know what it's going. I mean, I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says. I mean... Tell me how to do it. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you tell them to... Just stay up and do something different. You know, just... Come on. Let me try again. Try again. What do you think? I like it. I like it a lot. This? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Keep going. That's the path. I think this is the future. What are you doing over there? Come here. Meet me so soon. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. Love is the moon. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. I'll just put you on the bed. Hey, hey, sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I'm pretty militant about sleep training and going to begin with and then you're crushed. By the time it sends a love, she's on the deadline. She want me up to join us. I know, I know, worse, her, or whatever. We're just juggling a bit of stuff at the moment. By the time it came part, and she's under a lot of pressure. Like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes, sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of already. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. He's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't really have memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever. Like, you know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for them when it's older. You okay? I see it was around him when he was a baby. So, grab a pen, and slip the paper. You can pin them on that board there. Like you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know where the idea came from. It's sort of weird. When I spend time with Orey, I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. He and Orey, reminds me of being with my sister, but there she is. She's not pitching. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home, this was the former current start. I remember when I was a child, I was like, well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess, because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. And become other people. Live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground, so we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, we got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly, but it felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young, and you have no real sense of consequence at that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried out completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for Ari. Something permanent. Etch it in just stone so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master is awake, is he? Just a sec. I'll go see to him and maybe you can meet him if he isn't too grumpy. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Mr. Two days. It's not a big... Violet. It's shared custody. But I hardly get to see him as is. No, no. If he misses a couple days of school, because I want to take him on tour, I'm spending some quality time with him. My son is not actually in the group. What do you mean? Don't be ridiculous. It's not like he's been. Don't understand by them. I'm actually allowed to make a decision without money if we see the fucking detail by you. Future days are killed to see the world the way you guess. But that's not fair. No, no, look by that. Violet, listen to me. Look out. You cannot speak to the person. I've been worried, so. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Finish. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How much did you hear about? Yeah. Okay. So I'm not going to say anything. I'll just tell myself I totally won that argument. I heard. Nothing much. Yeah, I'm trying to. To be a good father. To make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see all either of them. You know, especially with Torin all the time. Both. I understand it's hard when you're a musician. A little unconventional. Violet just went to see you like that. So what do you think about having? I'm going to tell you about the time it's about the origin of York. No. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. Time was up because I all Iyeah you. I know you. But I know what I'm going to tell was. That's exactly what it really was. I remember myÈï∑ial from the ÎÇ¥Í∞Ä havaIrabIy And I wrote on the bank. Didn't I? I was. I was. I took him to sleep no more and to the mat I've caught sight tickets at the nap thing Thalnamar is then that's nice So why not go back to those my boys It was human drug in the hour bed in the morning because he wanted to go out and then do more and see more And I've been you I meant to my father and We didn't have much of relationship I'm pretty left, but I want to know what he needs to mean I want him to have memory that it looks upon fun thing you know not just the rock star father that was never there I understand after the time I think that's all that we are Memory It's true What's your little friend you know I've been thinking a lot about memories lately. What's the one thing that you'll never want to forget? Probably my My mother I'll never want to forget her. She brought me up Family is so important. I've been trying to hold on to as many moments with my own son ory as I can He's growing up so fast. I did didn't I? Yeah, sorry about that I guess I've just been on my mind a lot with this trip to New York coming up and all That's normal, but you're doing your best, right? Yeah, I try to it's funny being a father makes you realize how much you don't know you know I Know I know It's hard especially struggle everything anyway. We should get going the others are waiting for us to go eat Before we do there's something I wanted to share with you Exactly and sometimes I feel like I'm dropping the ball, you know But I'm working on a new project that might actually make things a little easier Okay, tell me more I'll tell you about the thamata. I'll eat in York Please No, please please don't I can't please just for a moment.

I've had them the whole time in my pocket Goodness me I've been writing my memoirs Which is difficult because I'm I'm losing everything things I always did that Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest we used to play in oh that was scary Oh I am aware I'm not what I used to be I've been getting people to send me voice notes The warnings of what they remember I got this one from by look the other day. It's it's the darkness thing God this is embarrassing Okay, here it goes It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant I was actually running 15 minutes late But then I rushed I yeah I rushed into the restaurant and you weren't there I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean When I met you at your gig you just seemed like this impossible be cool young guy So yeah, the idea of your ghosting me did it feel completely implausible and we didn't have cell phones back then So I couldn't just ring you to check And then finally this young man hustles into the restaurant When it wasn't you Remember I had only seen you with makeup so I wasn't even sure what you look like without that the big hair and the outfit I'm honest It was just about ready to call it quits when you finally question Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all You were you were so freaked out by the fact that you were late and Although I didn't know this yet and this is because of who you are Chris Just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh My god, I'm so sorry. I miss the buzz and decided that I should probably just Run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake because I counted four buses Passing me on my way and I got caught in the rain obviously, but Well, I mean I'm just really sorry and I'm Chris I was touched by it Yeah, this complete stranger would seem I don't know so together and beautiful when he was performing And but now dripping with water and sweat was He was only aware of me of how I might be feeling And I know I I didn't know immediately how to respond but Yeah, you you don't really start talking about Your music and it was Sort of incredible Like Hold a meter Shifting It was He keep behind the curtain of someone We just met but there was such openness about it. It felt almost Intimate I felt almost intimate like you were completely on a phrase to show me yourself Um, and then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister Lily And how it destroyed your family after she passed away and How it destroyed you And I was just Thumbstruck Chris Because it's just it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply I know all the other three states have usually only involved in small talk Yeah, I remember thinking My god, they're such bravery to this guy And I actually wanted to rejoued him But I wasn't brave enough myself I think at that point you might have actually made a joke But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying Was it really paying attention So I didn't know whether to laugh or not But then I started talking to you about my work and Other completely and consequential stuff and Just listen Like you really wanted to hear And then I know it sounds it sounds a little corny but by dessert I already knew I wanted everything with you I The house the garden the child The the getting all together I wanted all of it And later you insisted on paying to oh no makeup for being late So I excused myself and went to the bathroom Robin I God I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow. I was on pay and I swear No, please just this was our first day then I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom So if she comes back here this I should think of a fool Please Got such a It's true and and my day is gonna come back here and then you mean it so please just got me some slack I sure did go I'll come back tomorrow and settle up I die we have that policy that no no listen listen to me I'll give you my watch but I'm aware of one and or this bracelet it was it was my grandmother's And it's the most important thing I own it's not like I just jump here and then leave it Wow, that's what you going with you think that's gonna cover a tree-course meal And the wine and the wine Okay, wait wait what if what if I told you I can read your mind?

      " And then when we start, you're going to let me know if you see the following things. A door, a window, a partial window, a window and a bookshelf. If you see those, once you see those, I'll get the highlight and then you can enjoy yourself. Okay. Number two, at some point you're going to move from this room to that room. If it's not clear, I'll be here watching you and I can tell you good. Okay. Three, one spoken to, let him finish the phrase and then speak. Right. When you speak, speak at this level. You don't have to shout, but you just have to be who it. And number five, we reward people that explore it. I like the question. Three, I have one also. I'm going to buy this one. This is the battery and the, yeah. So let's go. You can even move it. There you go. Good. Good. Here we go. Sound. So you can see a door. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm free. You've really got me in shoes, I suppose. I should read out his numbers. I don't know if you're with the company in town. You know we're all proud, but remember, you do feel people are watching the while. Can't wait to hear what about it. You need to know how to hold on to my love you. Can you remember to bring that cake home, the one that made you love? Thank you. Where do you want it in the shower? You know the drill, makers have at home, grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink or my beer. Where is the coffee? Hello, Red. No, we can eat the one. Just two seconds. Hello. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but I guess it doesn't matter since we're eating out anyway. So what do you feel like eating French, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers? Only coffee. Dude, you can't survive on coffee alone. All right. We can grab some coffee and then meet up with the others. But you're going to have to eat something eventually. I've been in it. Do you have it? Come on, don't be like that. We haven't hung out in ages. And I've got some awesome news to share about my job. But first, let's get some food in you. I think I've got one or two bananas left over from last week. Let me check. Yeah. I've got one that's still not too ripe. You can have it. Okay, thank you. No worries, buddy. Now, let's get going. We don't want to keep the others waiting and I'm starving. Finally, grab the banana and let's roll. Okay. I'll tell you about the job on the... So, I just got the call yesterday and it looks like I might be getting a gig as a roadie for this new band that's touring the country. Okay, let's go to listen. Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Let's get out of here. Any... Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah, and no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just as the sight of me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, and kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like, what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariaka. So, there I am this morning, and little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And how she needs to trip her cut copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dorms on me. But gumber is sending me to the... ...copier room. And I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like, on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze. But I'm the new guy, and I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too gunk-gum scared of little gumber to ask for directions. So, I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three flights of stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite, and these two slit-challey sheen types ensuit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower, so I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. I know the copy of room is in the basement, so I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself, find the path, find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, at the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idle and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in office. So I'm freaking out, and I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing in Joe Sturm is singing. Am I lost in the supermarket? So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up all the documents, and I'm aligning the number dials, and I'm thinking, screw you Joe Sturm, I am lost, I'm gonna make it, but then I press copy, and then the alarm goes off. The screen on the front panel says, low ink. So I fill it with ink, and I'm so desperate by this point, I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over, and then it's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And noot she goes full in the blur in the exorcist. It sounds horrible to me, like everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's fire in paper, it's our sender, an alarm sounding. And the staff are rushing from their offices to see what's happening, and it's just me, standing alongside this screaming machine, coveted in looking like artics in the swan to sadness, and little goombas there with them. She doesn't say anything, she just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see I knew, I know her household. That was it. They fired me on this thought, I mean it's just a job, but you know, I really wanted, I don't know. Just to not mess up and make an impressing for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it on the couch. Yes, he's there. Yes, I see, he's on jacket. It's black. Hi honey, it's not. I saw your picture in a local newspaper today. He looked like a rock star, and it's taken a copy for you. Call me when you get a chance. I'd love to hear all about it. Both of those don't forget, it's all those best they've had in their quick. I'm really hoping I'm going to be there. Is there? I'd seen any possible universe in which issue, where this for the date? I don't know, maybe. Thanks man, I was worried I'd have to go out without it. It's getting chilly outside, we should hurry up. The others are probably waiting for us, right? No response? Wow. You really just gonna let me go out like this, huh? Okay, but... You take your jacket. You have to understand, it's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? You're the first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something... neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Do you see this name? A names by her and I met her on the gay tech flight. And she's just really cool. She's stoning to be an architect and she's funny and beautiful, like, across between brought shields and Jennifer Connolly. And she's just really smart. Do you see she loves you? What happened on the first date? God, I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted, so I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So, by the time I finally staggered into the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still. And I'm panicking, obviously. So, I start trying to explain myself. And she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a compensate even more. So, I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. I think I was running about my music and how criticising storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone, and I'll hurt to get in word in age raised. And then... Oh, Jesus. But I sort of realised that I'd been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So, I just thought, I tried lying the mood by telling a joke and just, oh god, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering, it's this Italian place. I say something dumb, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter's just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she's just... starts laughing. And so, I figuring that's it. I'm dead, I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in my head. And you asshole, you did it again, you actually met someone really cool and you just can't help but fuck it up with the very first junction. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It's fine because Violet the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing. And the music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can sign a house of her own from the ground up. And just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this skill is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and... ...till it was planned to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I ragged late so... ...while at least to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do-knocky gate, someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now. I'm convinced this guy has it against me. I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on my cheese. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... ...if they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet warts back in. I'm still on my knees in front of them so I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major day. And so... ...somehow... ...I had too much to get out of it. So... ...surely I can't mess it up twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such short notice. I just... I've got this... ...this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up. I just wanted to write her something. Something that... ...expresses what Shatchel means to me. I just... ...I can't... ...get it on the path. What'd you do when... ...when you're mentally blocked? Maybe I'd just show you what I've got. I've listened to some music... ...I have this melody, but... ...I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I mean, I like it, but... ...where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and... ...get a proper job like my dad says. I mean... ...Fuck! Tell me how to do it. Play it again. You know? Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend or... ...husband or wife. What actually means to you? I'm just... ...maybe I'm just no good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe telling me to... ...to stop and do something different. I mean, just... ...play for me. Ah! Play? Oh, try again. Yes, try again. What do you think? I like... ...play more. Yes? More. Come on. Come play with me. Can I... ...can I play with you? Come on, don't be scared. I'm not scared. Can I play with you? That's it. That's it. Can you carry her? Yeah. Let's... She's going, that's the path. Let's do something together. Come on. What are you doing here,grenie? Come here. Dub disappear. We're nine. What're you doing here,grenie? Come here. Do I? Yeah, I do. We like you. So it's a hurt. I'm just putting on each pad. Yeah, it's another room. Where are you? A piano. Do you? La Dios de rubir. Me ves y me quieres como mi opequero. Si de m√≠ te acuerdas como mi opequero. A veces escucho un eco divino que muerto en la brisa parece decir. Si te quiero mojar, mocha mocha mocha. Tanto me entonce siempre esta morir. Hey. Sorry about that. Hi. Hi. I really wanted to meet you all. But Violet and I have come pretty militant of our sleep training. We went to the game with them and got crushed. Violet sends a love. She's on deadline so she won't be up the join us. I know, I know, worse host ever. We're just joking about stuff at the moment. Violet came part and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit which is great obviously. But sometimes sometimes you don't have long enough to tag the old person in to take care of our internet. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Orey, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. Look, I had this idea. I wanted you to, well, it's a bit of a failure. I always burst those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't read up memories from the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical for them. It keeps it from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you've mind writing a message. It can be whatever you like. It doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better if it's about something that you know. About whatever your life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it would be really cool for when it's older. See if it was around him or his baby. So, grab a pen, slip the paper. You can pin them on that board there. Thank you for doing this. Do you want to know about it? I don't know where they are. They came from. It's sort of weird when I spend time at Rory. I remember things from my childhood. Things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temporal thing memory is. Be with Rory. It reminds me of being with my sister, Lily. There she is. Not picture. She and I used to play in this forest. Behind our family home. This was the former carriage bar. And that place was like, well, they're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. I guess because it was like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the leave behind. And we'd become other people. Live other lives. Because we're the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. So, we never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, Lily got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I mean, I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But we felt like an eternity at the time. And I was young. And you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. I can't find it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etching and just stirring so it can't be lost, right? Oh, the master of the wake is in. Lily, just a side. I'm going to see you too. Maybe you can meet him. He's into you from there. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. It's not a big one. By that thing. No, no. He made it a couple of days ago. That was a big one. But quality time is not as we get. What do you mean? Don't you ridiculous? It's not like you've been. You've been. No, you don't understand by that. I'm actually a lot of making a decision without wanting everything. You've been. No. No. No, no. Violet. You don't speak this way. I have a question. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no. I'll speak. Finish me. Oh. You again. Sorry. You again. How much did you hear about? Are you? A lot. It's your past life. It. It was your dream. It was the inner forest. One minute you're in the midst of something. And the next, it's just a memory. Becoming a musician was, yeah. I've been lucky enough to live that dream. I'm trying to know I'm starting to think about what's next. To be a good father. I'm going to get to work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see why that often. Did you do voices? Especially with Torion all the time. Well. Did you? little unconventually, that Violet just went to see you like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I took Origin New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows and it was very last minute, but I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US, because all his Christmases came at once. There were small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew we'd have some downpipe. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. You are father. Explored the city. And Peck Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more and until the maps are caught sight tickets of the nap time. What is the name of the film? The streamfermist does also the film. He stayed up late for the shows, but it was him dragging the out bed in the morning. He wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you, I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after we left. But I want to know what he means to me. I want him to have memory that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. I'm ready. You know, it's funny. I was just thinking about that the other day. What's the one thing you'll never want to forget? You know? My daughter. It's beautiful being a parent changes everything, doesn't it? I feel the same way about Ori. He's the light of my life. I understand. It's your son. It's a feeling that's hard to put into words, but it's like your whole world shifts when you have a child. Sorry, we should get going. The others are waiting for us. Ori, yeah. I've got some news about him, actually. I was going to tell you later, but I think I might as well share now. Okay, let's go. Just a minute. I want to grab something real quick. A photo of Ori, I want to show it to the guys. Okay, show me. This is him. Taken on our last trip to New York. He's getting so big. How many? Please. No, please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. Please. Please don't. I can't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so. What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. I don't really remember where they went. They were down. I didn't think they had this place. They weren't down. They were out there. They're out there, come on. They've gone jumping. Do they... No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't let them. Please don't, I told you, stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's human. Oh, it's you. Sorry, I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. Wingards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. You just missed Orey. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I mean to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I just... I'm trying to know where. I don't see your glasses. I'm trying. Would you help me find them? Yes. Let's try. They could be in the bookshelf. Okay. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. Or the drawers. No, in the books. I want to sofa. Or maybe under the table. Neither. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Okay, become. I'm going to try. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm sorry I've become so forgetful. Wait a minute. Oh, that is embarrassing. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. The whole time in my pocket. I've goodmixed me. I've been writing my memoirs. It was just difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister in the forest? Yes. That was scary. Yes, I saw. I'm afraid I don't see your glasses. I'm aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. Oh, I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darnest thing. Oh, yeah. God, this is embarrassing. Okay, here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed, yeah, I rushed into the restaurant. And you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. I mean, when I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this was possibly cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. And we didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. And then finally, this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a cleanist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally rushed in. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late. And that was a mistake, because I counted four buses passing me on my way. And I got caught in the rain, obviously, but well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. I thought I was going to touch it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I didn't know we immediately had a response. But yeah, you don't really start talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, you're holding me there, shifting. It was, it wasn't he keep behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Yeah, it felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister, really. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it destroyed you. And I was just, thumb struck, Chris. It's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself and then I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work and other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listen. Like, you really wanted to hear. And I know it sounds a little corny, but by dessert, I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. And I'm like, excuse myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow, I was on pay and I swear. What about your lady friend? Sure, the ship lost her wallet as well. No, please, this was her first date and I was really late and I insisted on paying before she went to the bathroom. So if she comes back here, this... I don't think I'm a fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know? Got such a... He says it doesn't know she's wallet. It's true. And my day's gonna come back here and then you minute, so please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle up. I die. We have the policy that... No, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm a wearer one. Or this bracelet. It was my grandmother's. This is the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with? You think that's gonna cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you gotta be kidding. That's how you're gonna play this? Yeah, that's how you're gonna play this? I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. Wait a second. So you think you're a baby copperful, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I had a star. Baby copper, be a hero. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with a bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway, so... What did you go up to lose at this point? Love being it. Love being it. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's gonna take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Abish? Yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brain off to be dangerous. Excuse me, seniorius and your. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and sleep, but the seams don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's played at gold and proscato pizza. Lands with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose him. Cool and clean and you. Your scribbles on a magazine, you flash a smile, trip on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games, you'll never win. You wanna read my mind. That's sweet, but I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin, you check the bill. No wallet now, oh what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet, collateral chic. And promise to return, babe, give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close, you're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming, but near the end. One wrong move, one misreply. And you're on dish-duty, no alibi. The music swells, the moment spins. You bluff too hard, nobody wins. So place your bet and hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaps. You're saying you play a slick. But here's the twist, one wink too slow. One move, you win. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes. She saw the seam, she knows the fake. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin, hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves, goodbye. I'll raise a toast and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin. Well, I said slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date, a mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft souls. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a more walk out the door. I set the table to in the light. I'm a little bit more. I'm a little bit more. I'm a little bit more. I'm a little bit more. But if I ever step into a door. I set the table to in the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you noctya. Then I can count. From broken lines to prosecute nights. I've turn disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And the stare you brought your grin. Your little show. But Filio me, you're the same trash too. A ray he played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Cape, The last fight on a porcelain plate The whispered Mamma Mia in your plight A Laura Strong's by a fancou I am not a man I'm Geno, don't even try Great, just great Show us what you got Okay, no pressure, Chris, no pressure, bye Okay, bye, read my mind then There are five objects in front of you Lay down in line, left or right, but we start here The salt, everyone starts on this What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, don't point, don't look at it too long Hold it, that is your beginning When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are now You can move left or right, whichever is closer, one step Only the object beside it, no skipping, and no jumping to the other side of the line Just follow I don't follow, I lead Slide, slide You think you can read my mind? These heads more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection I would better hear Yeah, like Niki Meible It's crack went in now Test band, although orange is only a north-working Nebraska, we'll answer the radio Slide, slide Paula Tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled Yeah, it's got to rewind the microwave last week You know this anymore? They're falling away Slide You know, on the salt anymore that part's over Slide That means this is not either. Which means this is your object. Ma dona maa. Que figada. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the trick. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling, and I asked you why. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried that I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The base drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. That's as far as we have so far. Wonderful. Wow. What an experience. This... There were... This extent of reality is so weird. If I understood better, there are English, but Anna is Anna, and I'll lose the points with... With the graphics, things, and the things. It's wonderful. I think it's less than lyrics. The last scene is actually not where it is. That's not the full film. Which is probably what gets to be retired. It's very much static images. And then suddenly you have the choreography. That's what we call them. It's not as good as we were. It's not very good. It's not very good. And so it's going to happen.\n",

      " at the beginning of the piece just to make sure that you are seeing correct. So what you should see is a window, a window and a window. Okay. If you see those four things, then we know where in the right place. Sorry. Sorry. Da, da, da, we know. And book shall book. Number two, when you're spoken to, speak loud. Not loud, but just normally in the West. Number three, wait until he finishes speaking before you speak. Yeah. And then there's a moment to change from this room to that room. And if you don't see it, then don't worry. I'll let you know when that is. Okay. And then finally, the last thing is just explore and have fun. You need to help me during this stuff. Another one is too tight. No, it's okay. Second, let me just open this up a little bit. Let me pull this back. Yeah, that's better. And then you put your bun on the other side. There you go. How's that? No, no, wait a second. Yeah, I really need to move your bun. Okay, let me remove the bun. It's easier. Wait. No, it's no, it's no. Is this? Okay. No bun. Oh, yeah, that's better. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Here we go. Come here. Come here. We'll never be in this position, but they've always coming from the outside for over. You're still in the same place, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah, I only see a lobby main. I'm entering. Yeah. So, yeah. Dark Rindo bookshelf. I'm going to send you the book. Leave your name, phone number and shoe size. Hi, sweetheart. It's none. I have to jump into the publishing house. You know, we're all proud, but remember, you do still need to call those ones in a while. You can't wait to hear all about it during Christmas. We should love you. All of them are big. Can you remember to bring that case card? I don't know. You know the drill makers have it home. Grab a coffee or whatever. Just don't drink on my beer. Take on me. Take on me. Oh, big girl. Thanks. Sorry about the mess. I meant to clean up, but we're eating out anyway, right? So, what's your take? Do you want to go for French, Italian, Chinese or just slum it and go for burgers? Burgers. Ah, the good old burger joint. Let's go make some questionable choices with extra cheese and fries. That sounds great. Burgers it is. I was thinking we could try out this new joint downtown. I've heard their patties are huge. You game? Yes. I'm really excited to share it with you. And the others are meeting us there. Alex and Mike should already be at the burger place. We can catch up with them. Okay, let's go. Let's roll. I'll just grab my walkman. I want to make sure we've got some tunes for the walk. What do you think? Some spring steam or maybe some durand-duran? Durand-duran sounds nice. Sweet. I've got their new cassette. It's been on repeat all week. Rios an amazing album. Shall we get going? Yep. Let's go. I'm going to hit play and we can jam out to hungry like the wolf. Love that song. It's like the ultimate anthem. Lead the way, man. You know the shortcut to the burger place. And by the way, have you talked to Rachel lately? Man is good to see you. I had such a terrible day. I got fired. I told you about that new job. Sorry. Internship. Are the publishing house? Well, the head of my department, she's called Sarah. And no exaggeration. The woman is certifiably insane. I mean, she's either one of those people who just wakes up angry every morning or made it just a sight at me that does it to her. But either way, whenever she spots me, she looks like she wants to kill me. She's sort of sure, you know, kind of boundish with these intensely manicured eyebrows. Like what's it called? Little gumber. You know, front-mariya got. So there I am this morning. Little gumber summons me to a office. And she's ranting about the pressure she's under to get a current project completed. And as she needs to trip her goat copies of the 40 different documents she's holding. And then it dawns on me. But gumber is sending me to the copier room. I know it doesn't sound like much. With this fucking machine, man, I swear. Sarah might be little gumber, but just finding this thing is like an Arthurian quest. It's like on the other side of the building, and the place is a total maze, but I'm the new guy. I really want to make a good impression. And I'm too got gum scared of little gumber to ask with directions. So I just start running from room to room, pretending that I know where I'm going. But for the longest time, the whole place looks exactly the same. I charge up three fights to stairs, and across, and then up again. And suddenly I realize I'm on the top floor. It's the executive suite and these two slit-challey sheen types and suit to eyeball in me. And I know I'm not supposed to ever even set up in the ivory fucking tower. I just keep my head down and try to make out like everything's normal. But I know the copier room isn't a basement. So I get out of there. I start dashing back down, and I'm screaming at myself. Find the path. Find the path. Like I'm Indiana Jones by this point. You know, with the start of the film when he's trying to escape with the idol and shit is coming in from all sides. And I'm so gasped I stop for a water break. I start thinking I can hear little gumber yelling for me back in the office. So I'm freaking out. And I run down into the right room in the basement. And the jukebox is playing and Joe Stummer's singing. I'm all lost in the supermarket. So of course, I take that as some kind of sign from God that I'm fundamentally doomed. But then somehow I actually find it. And I'm loading up other documents and I'm lining the number down. And I'm thinking, screw you Joe Stummer. I am lost. I'm gonna make it. Then I press copy. And an alarm goes off. Screen on the front panel says no. So I fill it with ink and I'm so desperate by this point. I just start hammering the copy button over and over and over. It's like I've killed it. It makes this hideous grinding noise inside. And notes she goes full in the glare in the access system. So I was vomiting in, like, everywhere on the walls, on the floors, on the fucking ceiling. And it's firing paper out. It's our sender and alarm sounding. And the staff are worse off from their offices to see what's happening. And it's just me standing alongside this screaming machine, coveting, looking like our text in the swan to sadness. And little Goon was there with them. She doesn't say anything. She just stands there smiling at me. Just smiling like she's thinking, see, I knew, an asshole. That was it. They hired me on this spot. I mean, it's just a job. But, you know, I really wanted out of that. Just to not mess up and make an impression for once. Hey, can you see my jacket out there? I think I left it by the door. Yep. Is this one? Yeah. What do you think? Is there any possible universe in which I should wear this for the date? Yeah, looks good. Thanks. I was worried I lost it, by the way. How's it going? Thank God. For a minute, I thought I looked like a poor man's version of Uncle Jesse. You have to understand. It's important that I get this right. Tell me, have you ever had a really bad first date? My first date with this girl was a total disaster. That's why I'm going for this. Something neutral. Hopefully, I'll actually look normal this time. Her name's Violet, and I met her on the gay tag slide. And she's just really cool. She's stone to being architect, and she's funny, and beautiful, like, across between broad shields and genophonic. And she's just really smart. They'll tell you about what happened on the first date. I was so late. Lord knows how long she'd been waiting there. I had to change after rehearsal, and I tried to jump myself into a pair of trousers that were a little bit too fitted. So I missed the bus and ended up running to run there. And it started raining on the way, like, thundering down. So by the time my family's staggering to the restaurant, I looked like, I don't know, a cat that had just called out the urinal. And she's just sitting there quiet and sort of still, and I'm panicking, obviously. So I start trying to explain myself, and she doesn't really tell you anything. She's just sitting there, so still sort of like, what's her name? Adrian. In Rocky? It's nice that kind of gentle demeanor is. It makes me have a conversation even more. So I'm just blabbering at her. I mean, you know what I'm like when I get anxious, to be honest. I can't even remember what I was saying. But I think I was running about my music and how criticised I could storm my name and my plans for it and somehow that just spewed out my entire life story without stopping for breath. Let alone allow her to get a word in age raised and then. Oh, Jesus. Let us sort of realise that I've been talking nonstop and she's just looking completely overwhelmed. So I just thought, I tried lying in the mood by telling a joke and just, oh, it just died on me. And later when I'm ordering it, it's this Italian place. I say something done, asking for some, gee, knocky or something equally ignorant. And the waiter is just staring at me like I'm a moron. And she just starts laughing. And so I figuring that's it. I'm dead. I'm done. And I'm screaming at myself in the head. And you asshole, you did it again. You actually met someone really cool and we just can't help but fuck it up with the very first young child. Why is wrong with you? But probably because I've only just shot my stupid mouth for a second. It finally goes by like the opportunity to speak and she just starts talking about architecture and the creative intent when she's designing. The music she likes and how a dream is to one day buy some land so she can design a house of a roaming from the ground up and just... ...spell down. Thinking, my god, this skill is so fucking cool. And the rest of the day just passed in a flash and tell her it was time to pay. And I insisted to take care of it because I arrived late so violently used to go to bathroom. And I am about to deal with it when I realize I've left my wallet at home. And the waiter who already thinks I'm an asshole because of the whole do not gigate, someone's over the major day. And Violet's about to come back any second now and convince this guy has it against me. So I've got no more dignity left to save, right? So I just fall onto my knees in front of them. And I'm offering them a watch and any other possessions I had on me. I even promised them 25% more than the cost of the dinner if they just... If they'll just for the love of God cut me a little slack and let me come back tomorrow. And I must have looked so pathetic that the major detakes pity on me and agrees just as Violet walks by kin and I'm still on my knees in front of them. So I have to make out like I'm tying my shoelace whilst whispering. Thank you. To the major day. And so somehow I had to get out of it. So surely I got messaged twice in a row, can I? She's really special. Thanks for coming at such a short notice. I just... I've got this thing. It's for Violet. She's got a birthday coming up and I just wanted to write her something. Something that expresses what she actually means to me. And I just... I can't get it on the path. What you do when you're mentally blocked. Maybe I'll just show you what I've got. I have this melody but... I don't know. I don't know where it's going. I like it but... Where is this leading? Sometimes I think I should just let this music thing go and get a proper job. Like my dad says. Tell me how to do it. Tell you a boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife. What actually means to you? Maybe I'm just... Maybe I'm just not good at this. Maybe that's it. This is the universe. Tell them you're to... ...to stop and do something different. You just... ...ah! We'll try again. What do you think? Maybe this? Come on. Come play with me. Come on, don't be scared. That's it. Keep going. Keep going, that's the path. What are you doing? Come here. Meet yourselves at home. Meet yourselves at home. Meet yourselves at home. Meet yourselves at home. Meet yourselves at home. Meet yourselves at home. Hey. Sorry about that. I really wanted to meet you all. But by the night I've become pretty militant about sleep training. And the winter begins with and we've got crushed. By the end of the month, she's on deadline. So she won't be able to join us. And I know, I know, worse, her, or the other. We're just joking about stuff. And while it came part, and she's under a lot of pressure. And she and I were... ...like ships in the night. My music's taken off a bit, which is great, obviously. But sometimes... Sometimes you don't have long enough to tag me up person in to take care of Ari. Anyway, look, everything's great. Really, it is. Ari, he's amazing. He's like the best day of my life every day. It's mad. I wanted you to... ...it's a bit of a favor. I always birthed those coming up late to this month. And I was thinking about how people don't read up memories for the first few years of their lives. And I wanted to create something physical about it. It keepsake from this part of his existence. And I was wondering if you'd mind writing a message. I'd be like, it doesn't have to be a birthday message. I think it's better just about something that you know. About whatever life. You know, what you know now or what you wish you'd known that. I think it'd be really cool for when he's older. See what he was around him when he was a baby. So, rather than slip the paper, you can pin them on that board there. I think you could do this. I think he's going to love it. I don't really know what they are. They're in King's Rock. It's sort of weird when I spend time at Ari. I remember things from my childhood. You know, things I've forgotten. It made me realize what a temple of being memory is. You with Ari, you must be being with my sister, isn't it? There she is. I'm not pitching. She and I used to play this forest behind our family home. This was the former parents' part. And that place was like, well, we're sort of sacred to us in this weird kind of way. We were just like hours and whenever we went there, we'd leave the aching and the need behind. Become other people, live other lives. Because we were the kids, right? So, we're literally living in our imaginations of that. We'd embed whole kingdoms, dragons, castles. And because it just felt so like this gigantic playground. We never really considered the idea that it might be dangerous. One day, they got lost of that. We had a path that we always took to get in and out. And she just strayed, I guess. It was the worst thing I've ever experienced. I think that she found her again pretty quickly. But it felt like an eternity at the time. I was young and you have no real sense of consequence of that age. What it means to actually lose something that day. Carried it completely. Just how easy it is to lose something that you love. I guess that's why I want to have something for all of you. Something permanent. Etching to stone so it can't be left, right? Oh, the mustard is a lake, is it? Just a set. I'll go see to them. Maybe you can meet them. He's into it from there. Hi. Hi there, little buddy. Daddy's here. Daddy's here. Oh, can you break? Missed two days. It's not big. Violet. It's shared custody. But I can hardly get to see him out there. No, no. If he misses a couple days of school. That's a quality time with my son. What do you mean? It's all good, ridiculous. I'm not going to be being too selfish. No, you don't understand, Violet. I'm actually allowed to make a decision. But I'm planning to be still fucking detailed by you. Jesus, please, you're not going to be able to leave me. Violet, that's not bad. No, no, look, Violet. Violet, they love Hyde. I don't think it's like Hyde. I hope people won't. No, I'll... Yeah. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Fine. Okay. Finish me. Oh. Sorry. I didn't hear you guys coming. How much did you hear about? Not much. Oh, not much. Great. Then you missed by a award-winning performance of man yelling into a cell phone. Things are just... You know. Messy. Yeah, I'm trying to... To be a good father. And to make it work in a pretty shitty situation. I don't see R.E. that often. You know. Especially with Torin all the time. Well... I'm approaching it a little unconvincially. Violet just went to hear like that. Did Erwin tell you about the time I could owe you to New York? He loved it. We only had a couple of shows. It was very last minute. I figured what the hell? I'll take him with me. He'd never been to the US. Because all his Christmas, it came at once. And there were some small shows, small acoustic swatts for the big bands that like the concept of exclusivity. But I knew he'd have some downpipe. And we spent all that time together. Me and him. Explored the city. And had Korean food for the first time. I took him to sleep no more. And to the mat, I caught sight tickets at the nap, too. I loved it. This thing first, I was also first. We stayed up late for shows. He was even dragging me out of bed in the morning. Because he wanted to go out and do more and see more. And I've been you. I meant to my father. And we didn't have much of a relationship after he left. But I want to know what he needs to make. I want him to have memories that he looks upon fondly. Not just the rock star father that was never there. Half the time I think that's all that they are. Memory. You know, I've been thinking a lot about memories lately. What's the one thing that you'll never want to forget? Your family? That means a lot, thank. I was just talking to Ori the other day. And he was telling me about his trip to New York. Have I told you about that? Yes. Wow, okay, you've talked about that. I mean, did you at least hear the power I made a good point? No. I guess. I'll tell you about the climate that I ate in New York. Please. No, please. Please don't. Please, just for a moment. I don't remember where it is. I don't remember where it is that you go. I'm so... Safer. It's safer there. Where, though? Where... Oh, oh no. Oh no, no, no, where is she? What do they think? Of course they know. Idiot. You blithering idiot. You never let them see. Think. Do they... No. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't let them. Please don't. I told you. Stay in the path you have to. Oh. It's you. Sorry, I... I didn't hear you come in there. Let me have a look at you. My guards, you look so well. You all look the same age. It seems to be only me that's getting older. Um... You just missed Ari. He was just here. He was helping me trying to find... He was just here. He must have had to lead. Oh no. That's it. He was helping me to try and find my glasses. I need them to read it lunch, so... They're definitely in here. I'm certain of it. I don't know where. Could you... Would you help me find them? They could be in the bookshelf. Or in the cabinets. I found them there before. All the drawers. Or the sofa. Or maybe under the table. How about the chair? I don't think they're in there, but... Or the piano. Or the plant. Oh. I'm so sorry I forgot to put it. Oh, oh. That is embarrassing. I've had them the whole time in my pocket. Goodness me. I've been writing my memoirs. Which is difficult because I'm losing everything. I always did though. Did I tell you about the time I lost my sister and the forest we used to play in? Oh, that was scary. I am aware I'm not what I used to be. I've been getting people to tell me voice notes. The recordings of what they remember. I got this one from Violet the other day. It's the darkest thing. God, this is embarrassing. Okay, but here it goes. It was 1990 and it was an Italian restaurant. I was actually running 15 minutes late. But then I rushed... I went to the restaurant and you weren't there. I started to worry that you might actually have stood me up. When I met you at your gig, you just seemed like this impossible, cool young guy. So, yeah, the idea of your ghosting me didn't feel completely implausible. We didn't have cell phones back then, so I couldn't just ring you to check. Finally, this young man hustles into the restaurant. But it wasn't you. Remember, I had only seen you with makeup, so I wasn't even sure what you looked like without that. The big hair and the outfit. And if I'm a clenist, it was just about ready to call it quits when you finally crushed it. Yeah, and it was funny because you weren't cool at all. You were so freaked out by the fact that you were late. And although I didn't know this yet, and this is because of who you are, Chris. I just always completely focused on how other people interpret your actions. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I missed the buzz and decided that I should probably just run here. Yeah, because I didn't want to be late and that was a mistake. Because I counted four buses passing me on my way, and I got caught in the rain, obviously, but, uh, well, I mean, I'm just really sorry. And I'm Chris. Uh, God, I was touched by it. How this complete stranger would seem, I don't know, so together and beautiful when he was performing. But now, dripping with water and sweat was only aware of me of how I might be feeling. And I, I know, I didn't know we immediately had a response. But yeah, you don't already started talking about your music, and it was sort of incredible. Like, your whole demeanor, shifted. It was, it was like peeking behind the curtain of someone. We just met, but there was such openness about it. It felt almost intimate. Like, you were completely unafraid to show me yourself. And then the conversation segwayed into a story about your sister, Lily. And how it destroyed your family after she passed away. And how it distraught you. Um, I was just dumbstruck, Chris. Because it's just extremely rare that anyone feels comfortable. It's comfortable enough to open up about the things that have affected them the most deeply. And I don't know, all my other first dates have usually only involved in small talk. Yeah, I remember thinking, my God, they're such bravery to this guy. And I actually wanted to reach out and take your hand. But I wasn't brave enough myself. I think, I think at that point you might have actually made a joke. But I was still a bit so stunned by what you've been saying. There wasn't really, I don't know, was there really name attention? So I didn't know whether to laugh or not. But then I started talking to you about my work. And other completely inconsequential stuff. And you just listened. Like you really wanted to hear. And then I know it sounds a little corny, but my dessert. I already knew I wanted everything with you. I like the house, the garden, the child, the getting old together. I wanted all of it. And later you insisted on paying to make up for being late. So I excused myself and went to the bathroom. Robin? Oh yeah, God, I'm really sorry, but I seem to have lost my wallet. Seriously, I'm not lying. I can come back here tomorrow and I'm paying. I swear. What about your lady friend? Surely she had lost her wallet as well. No, please, this was her first date and I was really dating and I insisted on paying before she was born. So if she comes back here, this, she'll think of my fool. Please. But you are a fool. You know. What's that, chair? He says it was his wallet. It's true. And my day is going to come back here and any minute. So please just got me some slack. I swear to God I'll come back tomorrow and settle. I die. We have the policy that, no, no, listen, listen to me. I'll give you my watch, but I'm aware of one. And then, uh, or this bracelet, it was, it was my grandmother's. And it's the most important thing I own. It's not like I just jump here and then leave it. Wow. That's what you're going with. You think that's going to cover a tree-caused meal? And the wine. Don't forget the wine. And the wine. Okay, wait, wait. What if, what if I told you I can read your mind? Oh, you've got to be kidding. That's how you're going to play this? Yeah, that's how you're going to play this. I can do it. Let me show you. Wait a second. So you think you're very cobb-a-feel, huh? Yeah, I didn't realize I ever start. Maybe couple of you here. Seriously, if I privit to you and leave you with the bracelet and well, and clearly you don't believe me anyway. So, where did you go to lose at this point? La Bain√©. La Bain√©. But if you get it wrong, we just lost our dishwasher. It's going to take a lot more than that bracelet to get you out of this. Cabiche? Yeah, yeah, thank you. You might just be dumb enough to be a genius, or brine off to be dangerous. Excuse me, senior-issignor. Please gather around. We seem to have some free entertainment for you tonight. This strong, what's your name? Chris is going to delight you with a magic trick. You stroll and slick, but the scenes don't hold. Callin' Genokey like it's played at gold and proscaito pizza. Lans with flair. I nearly choked on the midnight air that girls oppose. Cool and clean, and you. Your scribbles on a magazine. Your flash of smile. Trick on grace. You're trying to lead, but lost the pace under the neon sky. You spin, guessing games. You'll never win. You want to read my mind. That's sweet. But I've got depths you can't repeat. You twitch, you grin. You check the bill. No wallet. Now, oh, what a thrill. You slit me a bracelet. Collateral chic. And promise to return, babe. Give it a week. I'm the hush behind the velvet rope. The flicker in your last ditch, hope. You think you're close. You're still page one. And I don't play unless I've won. Under the neon sky, my friend. Your act is charming. But near the end, one wrong move. One mistriply in your own dish. Do you know, alibi? The music swells. The moment spins. You bluff too hard. Nobody wins. So place your bet. And hold that grin. The plates are stacked and soaked. You're sinned. You play it slick. But here's the twist. One wink too slow. One move you missed. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One move you missed. Now look at you all at no grace. A punchline wearing her perfume's trace. You pranced in light. Forgot the stakes, she saw the seams. She knows the fate. So pitch your charm. Reverse that grin. Hope she don't see the clown within. But if she laughs and waves. Goodbye, I'll raise a post and watch you try. You'll bow and blurt. You'll beg and spin while I sit slow and drink it in. I've been called many things. A major date. A mind reader. A mood sculptor. A miracle in soft salts. But me, I'm just Gino. I know the sigh of county port. I've seen a mor, walk out the door. I set the table to the lights. I cue the strings that kiss the night. I save you, no tape. And I can count from broken lines to prosekoneights. I've turned disasters into flair with just a gradsy. And to stare you brought your grin. Your little show, but fill your ne'o the same trace to array. You played your part. I won't deny, but you can't trick the Kindelman jar. I'm velvet in a hurricane. The last fight on a porcelain plate. The whispered Mama Mia in your plight. A Laura strums by a fan who I am not a man. I'm Gino. Don't even try. Great. Just great. Show us what you got. Yeah, show us. Okay, no pressure, Chris. No pressure, bye. Okay. Bye. Read my mind then. There are five objects in front of you. Lay down in line, left or right. But we start here. The salt. Everyone starts on this. What are we doing? Season in the air for good luck? Just in your mind, John Point. Don't look at it too long. Hold it. That is your beginning. When I say slide, you'll move your attention to the object right beside the one you are and now. You can move left or right, whichever is closer. One step. Only the object beside it. No skipping and no jumping to the other side of the line. Just follow. I don't follow. I lead. Slide. Slide. You think you can read my mind? Please, it's more locked up than a mob accountant witness protection. I would better hear. Yeah, like me, me, me. It's crack-knife now. That's bad. Although, one sees only a mob working at Nebraska. Real under the radar. Slide. Slide. Paula Tricks, huh? Your family must be thrilled. Yeah, he tried to rewind to my quiz last week. Hey. You know this anymore? They're falling away. Slide. You know the salt anymore. That part's over. Slide. That means this is not it either. Which means this is your object. Ma donna ma. Oh, gifigata. Oh, he's the spark in a velvet storm. Snapping time with a twist repo. Eyes on fire. All set? I remember being so struck by how you looked while you performed the track. It was the same way you looked when you played. Free. From everything. From yourself. And as we were walking out, you were smiling and asked, you're wide. But you just shook your head and told me that you've been worried. That I was only using the bathroom as an excuse to run out on you. Because you never believed that someone like me would enjoy spending time with someone like you. And we walked outside. And the red and yellow sunset covered the streets which were steaming after the rain. This was the best day of my life. The candle is flair. The base drops low. Time took a pause. Now it's ready to go. The diners. That's it. Do I like it? Yeah. I don't understand the images at the end. Some of them. No, that's because it's a placeholder. It's a placeholder. Oh, okay. Well, that's going to be a film. Thanks. Because I was always with the kitchen. And the friend I was like, I don't understand why is the kitchen here. It's just because I'm having an entrance. Oh, yeah. The guy sometimes loses his foot. Yeah, there's a lot of those in the relationship. Okay. But it's nice. This is not finished. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course it's the test.\n",
