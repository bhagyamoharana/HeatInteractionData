# HeatInteractionData

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and related assets for analyzing heat interaction patterns in different environments, possibly in the context of extended reality (XR), user experience, or cognitive performance studies.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 📊 Contents

The notebook includes:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handles missing values, outliers, and prepares the dataset for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Generates statistical summaries and visualizations to understand heat interaction trends.

- **Visualizations**  
  Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to display:
  - Heatmaps
  - Time-series plots
  - Comparative metrics (e.g., across user groups)

- **Insights**  
  Observations and initial conclusions based on data patterns and anomalies.
